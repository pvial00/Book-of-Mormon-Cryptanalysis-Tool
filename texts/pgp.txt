Introduction
The Pearl of Great Price is a selection of choice materials touching
many significant aspects of the faith and doctrine of The Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. These items were translated and
produced by the Prophet Joseph Smith, and most were published in the
Church periodicals of his day.The first collection of materials carrying the title Pearl of Great
Price was made in 1851 by Elder Franklin D. Richards, then a member
of the Council of the Twelve and president of the British Mission. Its
purpose was to make more readily accessible some important articles
that had had limited circulation in the time of Joseph Smith. As Church
membership increased throughout Europe and America, there was a
need to make these items available.The Pearl of Great Price received
wide use and subsequently became a standard work of the Church by
action of the First Presidency and the general conference in Salt Lake
City on October 10, 1880.Several revisions have been made in the contents as the needs of
the Church have required. In 1878 portions of the book of Moses not
contained in the first edition were added. In 1902 certain parts of the
Pearl of Great Price that duplicated material also published in the
Doctrine and Covenants were omitted. Arrangement into chapters
and verses, with footnotes, was done in 1902. The first publication in
double-column pages, with index, was in 1921. No other changes were
made until April 1976, when two items of revelation were added. In 1979
these two items were removed from the Pearl of Great Price and placed
in the Doctrine and Covenants, where they now appear as sections 137
and 138. In the present edition some changes have been made to bring
the text into conformity with earlier documents.
Following is a brief introduction to the present contents:
1. Selections from the Book of Moses. An extract from the book of
Genesis of Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible, which he be- gan in June 1830.
2. The Book of Abraham. An inspired translation of the writings of
Abraham. Joseph Smith began the translation in 1835 after ob- taining some Egyptian papyri. The translation was published
serially in the Times and Seasons beginning March 1, 1842, at Nau- voo, Illinois.
3. Joseph Smith—Matthew. An extract from the testimony of Mat- thew in Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible (see Doctrine and
Covenants 45:60–61 for the divine injunction to begin the trans- lation of the New Testament).
4. Joseph Smith—History. Excerpts from Joseph Smith’s official testi- mony and history, which he and his scribes prepared in 1838–39
and which was published serially in the Times and Seasons in
Nauvoo, Illinois, beginning on March 15, 1842.
5. The Articles of Faith of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
A statement by Joseph Smith published in the Times and Seasons
March 1, 1842, in company with a short history of the Church
that was popularly known as the Wentworth Letter.

Chapter 1
(June 1830)
God reveals Himself to Moses—Moses
is transfigured—He is confronted by
Satan—Moses sees many inhabited
worlds—Worlds without number were
created by the Son—God’s work and
glory is to bring to pass the immortality
and eternal life of man.
The words of God, which he a spake unto Moses at a time
when Moses was caught up
into an exceedingly high b mountain,
2 And he a saw God b face to face, and
he c talked with him, and the d glory
of God was upon Moses; therefore
Moses could endure his presence.3 And God spake unto Moses, say- ing: Behold, I am the Lord God
a Almighty, and b Endless is my c name; for I am without beginning
of days or end of years; and is not
this endless?
4 And, behold, thou art my son;
wherefore a look, and I will show thee
the b workmanship of mine c hands;
but not all, for my d works are without e end, and also my f words, for they
never cease.
5 Wherefore, no man can behold
all my a works, except he behold all
my b glory; and no man can c behold
all my d glory, and afterwards remain
in the flesh on the earth.
6 And I have a work for thee, Moses,
my son; and thou art in the a similitude of mine b Only c Begotten; and
mine Only Begotten is and shall be
the d Savior, for he is full of e grace 
Moses 1:7–18 2
and f truth; but there is g no God beside me, and all things are present
with me, for I h know them all.
7 And now, behold, this one thing
I show unto thee, Moses, my son, for
thou art in the world, and now I show
it unto thee.8 And it came to pass that Moses
looked, and beheld the a world upon
which he was created; and Moses
b beheld the world and the ends
thereof, and all the children of men
which are, and which were created;
of the same he greatly c marveled and
wondered.
9 And the a presence of God withdrew from Moses, that his b glory
was not upon Moses; and Moses was
left unto himself. And as he was left
unto himself, he c fell unto the earth.
10 And it came to pass that it was
for the space of many hours before
Moses did again receive his natural
a strength like unto man; and he said
unto himself: Now, for this cause I
know that b man is c nothing, which
thing I never had supposed.
11 But now mine own eyes have a beheld God; but not my b natural,
but my c spiritual eyes, for my d natu- ral eyes could not have e beheld; for I
should have f withered and g died in
his presence; but his h glory was upon
me; and I beheld his i face, for I was
j transfigured before him.
12 And it came to pass that when
Moses had said these words, behold,
a Satan came b tempting him, saying:
Moses, son of man, worship me.
13 And it came to pass that Moses
looked upon Satan and said: Who
art thou? For behold, I am a a son of
God, in the similitude of his Only
Begotten; and where is thy b glory,
that I should worship thee?
14 For behold, I could not look upon
God, except his a glory should come
upon me, and I were transfigured
before him. But I b can look upon
thee in the natural man. Is it not so,
surely ?
15 Blessed be the name of my God,
for his a Spirit hath not altogether
withdrawn from me, or else where
is thy glory, for it is darkness unto
me? And I can judge between thee
and God; for God said unto me:
b Worship God, for him only shalt
thou c serve.
16 Get thee hence, Satan; deceive
me not; for God said unto me: Thou
art after the a similitude of mine Only
Begotten.17 And he also gave me commandments when he a called unto me out
of the burning b bush, saying: c Call
upon God in the name of mine Only
Begotten, and worship me.
18 And again Moses said: I will not
cease to call upon God, I have other

things to inquire of him: for his a glory
has been upon me, wherefore I can
judge between him and thee.b Depart
hence, Satan.
19 And now, when Moses had said
these words, a Satan cried with a loud
voice, and ranted upon the earth, and
commanded, saying: I am the b Only
Begotten, worship me.20 And it came to pass that Moses
began to a fear exceedingly; and as
he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of b hell. Nevertheless, c calling
upon God, he received d strength,
and he commanded, saying: Depart
from me, Satan, for this one God only
will I worship, which is the God of
e glory.
21 And now Satan began to tremble, and the earth shook; and Moses
received strength, and called upon
God, saying: In the name of the Only
Begotten, a depart hence, b Satan.
22 And it came to pass that Satan
cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, and a gnashing of
teeth; and he departed hence, even
from the presence of Moses, that he
beheld him not.
23 And now of this thing Moses bore
record; but because of a wickedness
it is b not had among the children
of men.24 And it came to pass that when
Satan had departed from the presence of Moses, that Moses lifted up
his eyes unto heaven, being filled
with the a Holy Ghost, which beareth
record of the Father and the Son;
25 And calling upon the name of
God, he beheld his a glory again, for it
was upon him; and he heard a b voice,
saying: Blessed art thou, Moses, for
I, the Almighty, have c chosen thee,
and thou shalt be made stronger than
many d waters; for they shall obey
thy e command as if thou wert f God.
26 And lo, I am a with thee, even unto
the end of thy days; for thou shalt
b deliver my people from c bondage,
even d Israel my e chosen.
27 And it came to pass, as the voice
was still speaking, Moses cast his eyes
and a beheld the earth, yea, even all
of it; and there was not a particle of
it which he did not behold, b discerning it by the c Spirit of God.
28 And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a a soul which he beheld not; and he
discerned them by the Spirit of God;
and their numbers were great, even
numberless as the sand upon the
sea shore.29 And he beheld many lands; and
each land was called a earth, and there
were b inhabitants on the face thereof.30 And it came to pass that Moses
called upon God, saying: a Tell me, I
pray thee, why these things are so,
and by what thou madest them?
31 And behold, the glory of the
Lord was upon Moses, so that Moses
stood in the presence of God, and

talked with him a face to face. And
the Lord God said unto Moses: For
mine own b purpose have I made
these things.Here is c wisdom and it
remaineth in me.32 And by the a word of my power,
have I created them, which is mine
Only Begotten Son, who is full of
b grace and truth.
33 And a worlds without number
have I b created; and I also created
them for mine own purpose; and
by the c Son I d created them, which
is mine e Only Begotten.
34 And the a first man of all men
have I called b Adam, which is c many.
35 But only an account of this
earth, and the inhabitants thereof,
give I unto you. For behold, there
are many worlds that have passed
away by the word of my power. And
there are many that now stand, and
innumerable are they unto man; but
all things are numbered unto me,
for they are mine and I a know them.
36 And it came to pass that Moses
spake unto the Lord, saying: Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and
a tell me concerning this earth, and
the inhabitants thereof, and also the
heavens, and then thy servant will
be content.
37 And the Lord God spake unto
Moses, saying: The a heavens, they are
many, and they cannot be numbered
unto man; but they are numbered
unto me, for they are mine.38 And as one earth shall pass away,
and the heavens thereof even so shall
another come; and there is no a end
to my works, neither to my words.39 For behold, this is my a work and
my b glory—to bring to pass the c immortality and d eternal e life of man.
40 And now, Moses, my son, I will
speak unto thee concerning this
earth upon which thou standest; and
thou shalt a write the things which I
shall speak.
41 And in a day when the children
of men shall esteem my words as
a naught and b take many of them from
the c book which thou shalt write,
behold, I will raise up another d like
unto thee; and they shall be e had
again among the children of men—
among as many as shall believe.
42 (These words were a spoken unto
Moses in the mount, the name of
which shall not be known among
the children of men.And now they
are spoken unto you. Show them not
unto any except them that believe.Even so. Amen.)

Chapter 2
( June–October 1830)
God creates the heavens and the earth—
All forms of life are created—God
makes man and gives him dominion
over all else.
And it came to pass that the Lord
spake unto Moses, saying: Behold,
I a reveal unto you concerning this b heaven, and this c earth; d write
the words which I speak. I am the
Beginning and the End, the e Almighty
God; by mine f Only Begotten I g created these things; yea, in the beginning I h created the i heaven, and the
earth upon which thou standest.
2 And the earth was without a form,
and void; and I caused b darkness to
come up upon the face of the deep;
and my c Spirit d moved upon the face
of the water; for I am God.
3 And I, God, said: Let there be a light; and there was light.
4 And I, God, saw the light; and that
light was a good. And I, God, divided
the b light from the darkness.5 And I, God, called the light Day;
and the darkness, I called Night; and
this I did by the a word of my power,
and it was done as I b spake; and the
evening and the morning were the
first c day.6 And again, I, God, said: Let there
be a a firmament in the midst of the
water, and it was so, even as I spake;
and I said: Let it divide the waters
from the waters; and it was done;
7 And I, God, made the firmament
and divided the a waters, yea, the
great waters under the firmament
from the waters which were above
the firmament, and it was so even
as I spake.
8 And I, God, called the firmament a Heaven; and the evening and the
morning were the second day.9 And I, God, said: Let the a waters
under the heaven be gathered together unto b one place, and it was
so; and I, God, said: Let there be dry
land; and it was so.
10 And I, God, called the dry land a Earth; and the gathering together
of the waters, called I the Sea; and I,
God, saw that all things which I had
made were good.
11 And I, God, said: Let the earth
bring forth a grass, the herb yielding
seed, the fruit tree yielding fruit,
after his kind, and the tree yielding
fruit, whose seed should be in itself
upon the earth, and it was so even
as I spake.
12 And the earth brought forth
grass, every herb yielding seed after

for seasons, and for days, and for

the firmament of the heaven to
give light upon the earth; and it
was so.
16 And I, God, made two great
lights; the greater a light to rule the
day, and the lesser light to rule the
night, and the b greater light was
the sun, and the lesser light was the
moon; and the stars also were made
even according to my word.
17 And I, God, set them in the fir- mament of the heaven to give light
upon the earth,
18 And the a sun to rule over the day,
and the moon to rule over the night,
and to divide the light from the
b darkness; and I, God, saw that
all things which I had made were
good;
19 And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.20 And I, God, said: Let the waters
bring forth abundantly the moving
creature that hath life, and fowl
which may fly above the earth in the
open firmament of heaven.
21 And I, God, created great  a whales,
and every living creature that mov- eth, which the waters brought forth
abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind; and
I, God, saw that all things which I
had created were good.
22 And I, God, blessed them, saying:
Be fruitful, and a multiply, and fill
the waters in the sea; and let fowl
multiply in the earth;
23 And the evening and the morn- ing were the fifth day.
24 And I, God, said: Let the earth
bring forth the living creature after
his kind, cattle, and creeping things,
and beasts of the earth after their
kind, and it was so;
25 And I, God, made the beasts of
the earth after their kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything
which creepeth upon the earth after his kind; and I, God, saw that all
these things were good.
26 And I, God, said unto mine a Only
Begotten, which was with me from
the b beginning: Let c us d make man
in our e image, after our likeness; and
it was so. And I, God, said: Let them
have f dominion over the fishes of
the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
and over the cattle, and over all the
earth, and over every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth.
27 And I, God, created man in mine
own a image, in the image of mine
Only Begotten created I him; male
and female created I them.
28 And I, God, blessed them, and
said unto them: Be a fruitful, and b multiply, and replenish the earth,
and subdue it, and have dominion
over the fish of the sea, and over
the fowl of the air, and over every
living thing that moveth upon the
earth.
29 And I, God, said unto man:
Behold, I have given you every herb
bearing seed, which is upon the
face of all the earth, and every tree
in the which shall be the fruit of a
tree yielding seed; to you it shall be
for a meat.
30 And to every beast of the earth,
and to every fowl of the air, and to
everything that creepeth upon the
earth, wherein I grant life, there shall
be given every clean herb for meat;
and it was so, even as I spake.

which I had made were very a good;
and the evening and the morning
were the b sixth day.
Chapter 3
(June–October 1830)
God created all things spiritually before
they were naturally upon the earth—
He created man, the first flesh, upon
the earth—Woman is a help meet
for man.
Thus the a heaven and the earth
were finished, and all the b host
of them.
2 And on the seventh day I, God,
ended my work, and all things which
I had made; and I a rested on the b seventh day from all my work, and
all things which I had made were
finished, and I, God, saw that they
were good;
3 And I, God, a blessed the seventh
day, and b sanctified it; because that
in it I had rested from all my c work
which I, God, had created and made.4 And now, behold, I say unto you,
that these are the generations of the
heaven and of the earth, when they
were a created, in the day that I, the
Lord God, made the b heaven and
the earth,
5 And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every
herb of the field before it grew. For
I, the Lord God, a created all things,
of which I have spoken, b spiritually,
before they were c naturally upon
the face of the earth.For I, the Lord
God, had not caused it to rain upon
the face of the earth. And I, the Lord
God, had d created all the children
of men; and not yet a man to till
the e ground; for in f  heaven g created
I them; and there was not yet flesh
upon the earth, neither in the water,
neither in the air;
6 But I, the Lord God, spake, and
there went up a a mist from the earth,
and watered the whole face of the
ground.
7 And I, the Lord God, formed man
from the a dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the b breath
of life; and c man became a living d soul, the e first flesh upon the earth,
the first man also; nevertheless, all
things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made
according to my word.
8 And I, the Lord God, planted a
garden eastward in a Eden, and there
I put the man whom I had formed.
9 And out of the ground made I,
the Lord God, to grow every tree,
a naturally, that is pleasant to the
sight of man; and man could be- hold it. And it became also a b living
soul.For it was spiritual in the day
that I created it; for it remaineth in
the sphere in which I, God, created
it, yea, even all things which I prepared for the use of man; and man
saw that it was good for food. And
I, the Lord God, planted the c tree of
life also in the midst of the garden,

and also the tree of knowledge of
good and evil.
10 And I, the Lord God, caused a
river to go out of a Eden to water
the garden; and from thence it was
parted, and became into four b heads.
11 And I, the Lord God, called the
name of the first Pison, and it compasseth the whole land of a Havilah,
where I, the Lord God, created much
gold;
12 And the gold of that land was
good, and there was bdellium and
the a onyx stone.
13 And the name of the second river
was called Gihon; the same that compasseth the whole land of a Ethiopia.14 And the name of the third river
was Hiddekel; that which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the
fourth river was the Euphrates.
15 And I, the Lord God, took the
man, and put him into the Garden
of a Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.
16 And I, the Lord God, commanded
the man, saying: Of every tree of the
garden thou mayest freely eat,
17 But of the tree of the a knowledge
of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of
it, nevertheless, thou mayest b choose
for thyself, for it is given unto thee;
but, remember that I c forbid it, for
in the d day thou eatest thereof thou
shalt surely e die.
18 And I, the Lord God, said unto
mine a Only Begotten, that it was not
good that the man should be b alone;
wherefore, I will make an c help meet
for him.19 And out of the ground I, the
Lord God, formed every a beast of the
field, and every fowl of the air; and
commanded that they should come
unto Adam, to see what he would
call them; and they were also living
souls; for I, God, breathed into them
the b breath of life, and commanded
that whatsoever Adam called every
living creature, that should be the
name thereof.
20 And Adam gave a names to all
cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and
to every beast of the field; but as for
Adam, there was not found an help
meet for him.21 And I, the Lord God, caused a
deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and
he slept, and I took one of his ribs
and closed up the flesh in the stead
thereof;
22 And the rib which I, the Lord
God, had taken from man, made I
a a woman, and brought her unto
the man.
23 And a Adam said: This I know now
is bone of my bones, and b flesh of
my flesh; she shall be called Woman,
because she was taken out of man.
24 Therefore shall a man leave his
father and his mother, and shall
a cleave unto his b wife; and c they shall
be d one flesh.
25 And they were both naked, the
man and his wife, and were not
ashamed.

And I, the a Lord God, spake unto
Moses, saying: That b Satan, whom
thou hast commanded in the name
of mine Only Begotten, is the same
which was from the c beginning, and
he came before me, saying—Behold,
here am I, send me, I will be thy
son, and I will d redeem all mankind,
that one soul shall not be lost, and
surely e I will do it; wherefore f give
me thine honor.
2 But, behold, my Beloved a Son,
which was my Beloved and b Chosen
from the beginning, said unto me— c Father, thy d will be done, and the e glory be thine forever.
3 Wherefore, because that a Satan b rebelled against me, and sought to
destroy the c agency of man, which
I, the Lord God, had given him, and
also, that I should give unto him
mine own power; by the power of
mine Only Begotten, I caused that
he should be d cast down;
4 And he became a Satan, yea, even
the b devil, the father of all c lies, to d deceive and to blind men, and to
lead them e captive at his will, even
as many as would not f  hearken unto
my voice.5 And now the serpent was more a subtle than any beast of the field
which I, the Lord God, had made.6 And a Satan put it into the heart of
the serpent, (for he had drawn away
b many after him,) and he sought also
to c beguile Eve, for he d knew not the e mind of God, wherefore he sought
to destroy the world.
7 And he said unto the woman:
Yea, hath God said—Ye shall not
eat of every tree of the garden?
(And he spake by the mouth of the
serpent.)
8 And the woman said unto the
serpent: We may eat of the fruit of
the trees of the garden;
9 But of the fruit of the tree which
thou beholdest in the midst of the
garden, God hath said—Ye shall not
eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,
lest ye die.
10 And the serpent said unto the a woman: Ye shall not surely die;
11 For God doth know that in the
day ye eat thereof, then your a eyes
shall be opened, and ye shall be as
gods, b knowing good and evil.12 And when the woman saw that
the tree was good for food, and that
it became pleasant to the eyes, and a
tree to be a desired to make her wise,
she took of the b fruit thereof, and did c eat, and also gave unto her husband
with her, and he did eat.
13 And the eyes of them both were
opened, and they knew that they
had been a naked. And they sewed
fig leaves together and made themselves b aprons.
14 And they heard the voice of the
Lord God, as they were a walking in

the garden, in the cool of the day;
and Adam and his wife went to hide
themselves from the b presence of
the Lord God amongst the trees
of the garden.15 And I, the Lord God, called unto
Adam, and said unto him: Where
a goest thou?
16 And he said: I heard thy voice
in the garden, and I was afraid, because I beheld that I was naked, and
I hid myself.
17 And I, the Lord God, said unto
Adam: Who told thee thou wast
naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree
whereof I commanded thee that thou
shouldst not eat, if so thou shouldst
surely a die?
18 And the man said: The woman
thou gavest me, and commandest
that she should remain with me,
she gave me of the fruit of the tree
and I did eat.
19 And I, the Lord God, said unto the
woman: What is this thing which thou
hast done? And the woman said: The
serpent a beguiled me, and I did eat.20 And I, the Lord God, said unto
the serpent: Because thou hast done
this thou shalt be a cursed above all
cattle, and above every beast of the
field; upon thy belly shalt thou go,
and dust shalt thou eat all the days
of thy life;
21 And I will put a enmity between
thee and the woman, between thy
seed and her seed; and he shall
b bruise thy head, and thou shalt
bruise his heel.22 Unto the woman, I, the Lord God,
said: I will greatly multiply thy sor- row and thy conception. In a sorrow
thou shalt bring forth children, and
thy desire shall be to thy b husband,
and he shall rule over thee.
23 And unto Adam, I, the Lord God,
said: Because thou hast hearkened
unto the voice of thy wife, and hast
eaten of the fruit of the tree of which
I commanded thee, saying—Thou
shalt not eat of it, a cursed shall be
the ground for thy sake; in b sorrow
shalt thou eat of it all the days of
thy life.
24 Thorns also, and thistles shall it
bring forth to thee, and thou shalt
eat the herb of the field.
25 By the a sweat of thy b face shalt
thou eat bread, until thou shalt return unto the ground—for thou shalt
surely die—for out of it wast thou
taken: for c dust thou wast, and unto
dust shalt thou return.
26 And Adam called his wife’s name
Eve, because she was the mother of
all living; for thus have I, the Lord
God, called the first of all women,
which are a many.
27 Unto Adam, and also unto his
wife, did I, the Lord God, make coats
of a skins, and b clothed them.
28 And I, the Lord God, a said unto
mine Only Begotten: Behold, the
b man is become as one of us to c know
good and evil; and now lest he put
forth his hand and d partake also of
the e tree of life, and eat and live
forever,
29 Therefore I, the Lord God, will
send him forth from the Garden of
a Eden, to till the ground from whence
he was taken;
30 For as I, the Lord God, liveth,
even so my a words cannot return

sword, which turned every way to
keep the way of the tree of life.32 (And these are the words which

Chapter 5
(June–October 1830)
Adam and Eve bring forth children—
Adam offers sacrifice and serves God—
Cain and Abel are born—Cain rebels,
loves Satan more than God, and becomes
Perdition—Murder and wickedness
spread—The gospel is preached from
the beginning.
And it came to pass that after I, the
Lord God, had driven them out, that
Adam began to till the earth, and to
have a dominion over all the beasts
of the field, and to eat his bread by
the sweat of his b brow, as I the Lord
had commanded him. And Eve, also,
his wife, did c labor with him.2 And a Adam knew his wife, and she
bare unto him b sons and c daughters,
and they began to d multiply and to
replenish the earth.
3 And from that time forth, the
sons and a daughters of Adam began
to divide two and two in the land,
and to till the land, and to tend
flocks, and they also begat sons and
daughters.
4 And Adam and Eve, his wife, a called upon the name of the Lord,
and they heard the voice of the
Lord from the way toward the Garden
of b Eden, speaking unto them, and
they saw him not; for they were shut
out from his c presence.
5 And he gave unto them commandments, that they should a worship the
Lord their God, and should offer the
b firstlings of their c flocks, for an offering unto the Lord. And Adam was d obedient unto the commandments
of the Lord.
6 And after many days an a angel
of the Lord appeared unto Adam,
saying: Why dost thou offer b sacrifices unto the Lord? And Adam said
unto him: I know not, save the Lord
commanded me.
7 And then the angel spake, say- ing: This thing is a a similitude of
the b sacrifice of the Only Begotten
of the Father, which is full of c grace
and d truth.8 Wherefore, thou shalt do all that
thou doest in the a name of the Son,
and thou shalt b repent and c call
upon God in the name of the Son
forevermore.
9 And in that day the a Holy Ghost
fell upon Adam, which beareth
record of the Father and the Son, saying: I am the b Only Begotten of the
Father from the beginning, henceforth and forever, that as thou hast
c fallen thou mayest be d redeemed,

and all mankind, even as many
as will.
10 And in that day Adam blessed
God and was a filled, and began to b prophesy concerning all the families of the earth, saying: Blessed be
the name of God, for because of my
c transgression my d eyes are opened,
and in this life I shall have e joy, and
again in the f flesh I shall see God.
11 And Eve, his wife, heard all
these things and was glad, saying:
Were it not for our transgression
we never should have had a seed, and
never should have b known good
and evil, and the joy of our redemption, and the eternal life which God
giveth unto all the obedient.12 And Adam and a Eve blessed
the name of God, and they made all
things b known unto their sons and
their daughters.
13 And a Satan came among them,
saying: I am also a son of God; and he
commanded them, saying: b Believe
it not; and they believed it not, and
they c loved Satan more than God.And men began from that time
forth to be d carnal, sensual, and
devilish.14 And the Lord God called upon
men by the a Holy Ghost everywhere
and commanded them that they
should repent;
15 And as many as a believed in
the Son, and repented of their sins,
should be b saved; and as many as believed not and repented not, should
be c damned; and the words went
forth out of the mouth of God in a
firm decree; wherefore they must
be fulfilled.
16 And Adam and Eve, his wife,
ceased not to call upon God. And
Adam knew Eve his wife, and she
conceived and bare a Cain, and said:
I have gotten a man from the Lord;
wherefore he may not reject his
words.But behold, Cain b hearkened
not, saying: Who is the Lord that I
should c know him?
17 And she again conceived and
bare his brother Abel. And Abel a hearkened unto the voice of the Lord.
And b Abel was a keeper of sheep, but
Cain was a tiller of the ground.
18 And Cain a loved Satan more
than God. And Satan commanded
him, saying: b Make an offering unto
the Lord.
19 And in process of time it came
to pass that Cain brought of the
a fruit of the ground an offering unto
the Lord.
20 And Abel, he also brought of the a firstlings of his flock, and of the fat
thereof. And the Lord had b respect
unto Abel, and to his c offering;
21 But unto Cain, and to his a offering, he had not respect. Now Satan
knew this, and it b pleased him. And
Cain was very wroth, and his coun- tenance fell.
22 And the Lord said unto Cain:
Why art thou wroth? Why is thy
countenance fallen?
23 If thou doest well, thou shalt
be a accepted. And if thou doest not
well, sin lieth at the door, and Satan b desireth to have thee; and except

thou shalt hearken unto my commandments, I will c deliver thee up,
and it shall be unto thee according
to his desire. And thou shalt d rule
over him;
24 For from this time forth thou
shalt be the father of his a lies;
thou shalt be called b Perdition; for
thou wast also c before the world.
25 And it shall be said in time to
come—That these abominations were
had from a Cain; for he rejected the
greater counsel which was had from
God; and this is a b cursing which
I will put upon thee, except thou
repent.
26 And Cain was wroth, and listened
not any more to the voice of the Lord,
neither to Abel, his brother, who
walked in holiness before the Lord.
27 And Adam and his wife a mourned
before the Lord, because of Cain and
his brethren.
28 And it came to pass that Cain
took one of his brothers’ daughters
to a wife, and they b loved Satan more
than God.
29 And Satan said unto Cain: a Swear
unto me by thy throat, and if thou
tell it thou shalt die; and swear thy
brethren by their heads, and by
the living God, that they tell it not;
for if they tell it, they shall surely
die; and this that thy father may
not know it; and this day I will deliver thy brother Abel into thine
hands.
30 And Satan sware unto Cain that
he would do according to his a com- mands. And all these things were
done in secret.31 And Cain said: Truly I am
Mahan, the master of this great a se- cret, that I may b murder and get c gain. Wherefore Cain was called
Master d Mahan, and he gloried in his
wickedness.
32 And Cain went into the field,
and Cain talked with Abel, his
brother. And it came to pass that
while they were in the field, Cain
rose up against Abel, his brother, and
slew him.
33 And Cain a gloried in that which
he had done, saying: I am free; surely
the b flocks of my brother falleth into
my hands.
34 And the Lord said unto Cain:
Where is Abel, thy brother? And he
said: I know not. Am I my brother’s a keeper?
35 And the Lord said: What hast
thou done? The voice of thy brother’s a blood cries unto me from the
ground.
36 And now thou shalt be a cursed
from the earth which hath opened
her mouth to receive thy brother’s
blood from thy hand.37 When thou tillest the ground
it shall not henceforth yield unto
thee her a strength. A b fugitive and
a vagabond shalt thou be in the
earth.
38 And Cain said unto the Lord:
Satan a tempted me because of my
brother’s flocks. And I was wroth
also; for his offering thou didst accept and not mine; my b punishment
is greater than I can bear.
39 Behold thou hast driven me out
this day from the face of the Lord,
and from thy face shall I be hid; and
I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond
in the earth; and it shall come to
pass, that he that findeth me will
slay me, because of mine iniquities,
for these things are not hid from
the Lord.40 And I the Lord said unto him:

Whosoever slayeth thee, vengeance
shall be taken on him sevenfold. And
I the Lord set a a mark upon Cain,
lest any finding him should kill him.
41 And Cain was a shut out from
the b presence of the Lord, and with
his wife and many of his brethren
dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east
of Eden.
42 And Cain knew his wife, and she
conceived and bare Enoch, and he
also begat many sons and daughters.
And he builded a city, and he called
the name of the a city after the name
of his son, Enoch.
43 And unto Enoch was born Irad,
and other sons and daughters. And
Irad begat Mahujael, and other sons
and daughters. And Mahujael begat Methusael, and other sons and
daughters. And Methusael begat
Lamech.44 And Lamech took unto himself
two wives; the name of one being
Adah, and the name of the other,
Zillah.
45 And Adah bare Jabal; he was the
father of such as dwell in a tents, and
they were keepers of cattle; and his
brother’s name was Jubal, who was
the father of all such as handle the
harp and organ.46 And Zillah, she also bare Tubal
Cain, an instructor of every artificer
in brass and iron. And the sister of
Tubal Cain was called Naamah.
47 And Lamech said unto his wives,
Adah and Zillah: Hear my voice, ye
wives of Lamech, hearken unto my
speech; for I have slain a man to
my wounding, and a young man
to my hurt.
48 If Cain shall be avenged seven- fold, truly Lamech shall be a seventy
and seven fold;
49 For a Lamech having entered
into a covenant with Satan, after the
manner of Cain, wherein he became
Master Mahan, master of that great
secret which was administered unto
Cain by Satan; and Irad, the son of
Enoch, having known their secret,
began to reveal it unto the sons of
Adam;
50 Wherefore Lamech, being angry, slew him, not like unto Cain,
his brother Abel, for the sake of getting gain, but he slew him for the
a oath’s sake.
51 For, from the days of Cain, there
was a secret a combination, and their
works were in the dark, and they
knew every man his brother.52 Wherefore the Lord a cursed
Lamech, and his house, and all them
that had covenanted with Satan;
for they kept not the commandments
of God, and it displeased God, and he
ministered not unto them, and their
works were abominations, and began to spread among all the b sons of
men. And it was among the sons
of men.53 And among the daughters of
men these things were not spoken,
because that Lamech had spoken
the secret unto his wives, and they
rebelled against him, and declared
these things abroad, and had not
compassion;
54 Wherefore Lamech was despised,
and cast out, and came not among
the sons of men, lest he should die.
55 And thus the works of a darkness
began to prevail among all the sons
of men.56 And God a cursed the earth with
a sore curse, and was angry with the
wicked, with all the sons of men
whom he had made;

unto his voice, nor believe on his
Only Begotten Son, even him whom
he declared should b come in the meridian of time, who was c prepared

be b preached, from the beginning,
being declared by c holy d angels sent
forth from the presence of God, and
by his own voice, and by the gift of

59 And thus all things were con- firmed unto a Adam, by an holy ordinance, and the Gospel preached, and

and thus it was. Amen.
Chapter 6
(November–December 1830)
Adam’s seed keep a book of remembrance
—His righteous posterity preach repentance—God reveals Himself to Enoch—
Enoch preaches the gospel—The plan of
salvation was revealed to Adam—He
received baptism and the priesthood.
And Adam hearkened unto the voice
of God, and called upon his sons to
repent.2 And Adam knew his wife again,
and she bare a son, and he called his
name a Seth. And Adam glorified the
name of God; for he said: God hath
appointed me another seed, instead
of Abel, whom Cain slew.
3 And God revealed himself unto a Seth, and he rebelled not, but offered an acceptable b sacrifice, like
unto his brother Abel. And to him
also was born a son, and he called
his name Enos.
4 And then began these men to a call
upon the name of the Lord, and the
Lord blessed them;
5 And a a book of b remembrance was
kept, in the which was recorded, in the
c language of Adam, for it was given
unto as many as called upon God
to write by the spirit of d inspiration;
6 And by them their a children were
taught to read and write, having
a b language which was c pure and
undefiled.
7 Now this same a Priesthood, which
was in the beginning, shall be in the
end of the world also.
8 Now this prophecy Adam spake,
as he was moved upon by the a Holy
Ghost, and a b genealogy was kept of
the c children of God. And this was
the d book of the generations of Adam,
saying: In the day that God created
man, in the likeness of God made
he him;
9 In the a image of his own b body,
male and female, c created he them,
and blessed them, and called their
d name Adam, in the day when they
were created and became living
e souls in the land upon the f footstool
of God.

in his own likeness, after his own

11 And the days of Adam, after he
had begotten Seth, were eight hundred years, and he begat many sons
and daughters;
12 And all the days that Adam lived
were nine hundred and thirty years,
and he died.
13 Seth lived one hundred and five
years, and begat Enos, and a prophesied in all his days, and taught his son
Enos in the ways of God; wherefore
Enos prophesied also.14 And Seth lived, after he begat
Enos, eight hundred and seven years,
and begat many sons and daughters.
15 And the children of a men were
numerous upon all the face of the
land. And in those days b Satan had
great c dominion among men, and
raged in their hearts; and from
thenceforth came d wars and bloodshed; and a man’s hand was against
his own brother, in administering
death, because of e secret f works,
seeking for g power.16 All the days of Seth were nine
hundred and twelve years, and he
died.17 And Enos lived ninety years, and
begat a Cainan. And Enos and the
residue of the people of God came
out from the land, which was called
Shulon, and dwelt in a land of promise, which he called after his own
son, whom he had named b Cainan.
18 And Enos lived, after he begat
Cainan, eight hundred and fifteen
years, and begat many sons and
daughters. And all the days of Enos
were nine hundred and five years,
and he died.
19 And Cainan lived seventy years,
and begat Mahalaleel; and Cainan
lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight
hundred and forty years, and begat
sons and daughters. And all the days
of a Cainan were nine hundred and
ten years, and he died.
20 And Mahalaleel lived sixtyfive years, and begat Jared; and
Mahalaleel lived, after he begat Jared,
eight hundred and thirty years, and
begat sons and daughters. And all
the days of Mahalaleel were eight
hundred and ninety-five years, and
he died.
21 And Jared lived one hundred and
sixty-two years, and begat a Enoch;
and Jared lived, after he begat Enoch,
eight hundred years, and begat sons
and daughters. And Jared b taught
Enoch in all the ways of God.
22 And this is the genealogy of
the sons of Adam, who was the a son
of God, with whom God, himself,
conversed.
23 And they were a preachers of b righteousness, and spake and c pro- phesied, and called upon all men,
everywhere, to repent; and d faith
was e taught unto the children of
men.
24 And it came to pass that all the
days of Jared were nine hundred and
sixty-two years, and he died.25 And Enoch lived sixty-five years,
and begat Methuselah.
26 And it came to pass that Enoch
journeyed in the land, among the people; and as he journeyed, the a Spirit
of God descended out of heaven, and
abode upon him.27 And he heard a a voice from
heaven, saying: b Enoch, my son,

c prophesy unto this people, and say
unto them—Repent, for thus saith
the Lord: I am d angry with this people, and my fierce anger is kindled
against them; for their hearts have
waxed e hard, and their f ears are dull
of hearing, and their eyes g cannot
see afar off;
28 And for these many generations,
ever since the day that I created
them, have they gone astray, and
have a denied me, and have sought
their own counsels in the dark; and
in their own abominations have they
devised murder, and have not kept
the commandments, which I gave
unto their father, Adam.29 Wherefore, they have foresworn
themselves, and, by their oaths, they
have brought upon themselves death;
and a a hell I have prepared for them,
if they repent not;
30 And this is a decree, which I have
sent forth in the beginning of the
world, from my own mouth, from
the foundation thereof, and by the
mouths of my servants, thy fathers,
have I decreed it, even as it shall
be sent forth in the world, unto the
ends thereof.31 And when Enoch had heard
these words, he a bowed himself
to the earth, before the Lord, and
spake before the Lord, saying:
b Why is it that I have found favor
in thy sight, and am but a lad, and
all the people c hate me; for I am d slow of speech; wherefore am I thy
servant?
32 And the Lord said unto Enoch:
Go forth and do as I have commanded
thee, and no man shall pierce thee.
Open thy a mouth, and it shall be
filled, and I will give thee utterance,
for all flesh is in my hands, and I will
do as seemeth me good.33 Say unto this people: a Choose
ye b this day, to serve the Lord God
who made you.
34 Behold my a Spirit is upon you,
wherefore all thy words will I justify;
and the b mountains shall flee before
you, and the c rivers shall turn from
their course; and thou shalt abide
in me, and I in you; therefore d walk
with me.
35 And the Lord spake unto Enoch,
and said unto him: Anoint thine eyes
with a clay, and wash them, and thou
shalt see. And he did so.
36 And he beheld the a spirits that
God had created; and he beheld also
things which were not visible to the
b natural eye; and from thenceforth
came the saying abroad in the land:
A c seer hath the Lord raised up unto
his people.
37 And it came to pass that Enoch
went forth in the land, among the
people, standing upon the hills and
the high places, and cried with a
loud voice, testifying against their
works; and all men were a offended
because of him.38 And they came forth to hear
him, upon the high places, saying
unto the a tent-keepers: Tarry ye
here and keep the tents, while we
go yonder to behold the seer, for he
prophesieth, and there is a strange
thing in the land; a b wild man hath
come among us.

39 And it came to pass when they
heard him, no man laid hands on
him; for a fear came on all them that
heard him; for he b walked with God.
40 And there came a man unto him,
whose name was Mahijah, and said
unto him: Tell us plainly who thou
art, and from whence thou comest?
41 And he said unto them: I came out
from the land of a Cainan, the land of
my fathers, a land of b righteousness
unto this day. And my father c taught
me in all the ways of God.42 And it came to pass, as I journeyed from the land of Cainan, by
the sea east, I beheld a vision; and
lo, the heavens I saw, and the Lord
spake with me, and gave me commandment; wherefore, for this cause,
to keep the commandment, I speak
forth these words.
43 And Enoch continued his speech,
saying: The Lord which spake with
me, the same is the God of heaven,
and he is my God, and your God, and
ye are my brethren, and why a counsel ye yourselves, and deny the God
of heaven?
44 The heavens he made; the a earth
is his b footstool; and the foundation
thereof is his. Behold, he laid it, an
host of men hath he brought in upon
the face thereof.
45 And death hath come upon our
fathers; nevertheless we know them,
and cannot deny, and even the first
of all we know, even a Adam.
46 For a book of a remembrance we
have b written among us, according
to the pattern given by the finger
of God; and it is given in our own
c language.
47 And as Enoch spake forth the
words of God, the people trembled,
and could not a stand in his presence.
48 And he said unto them: Because
that Adam a fell, we are; and by his
fall came b death; and we are made
partakers of misery and woe.
49 Behold Satan hath come among
the children of men, and a tempteth
them to b worship him; and men
have become c carnal, d sensual, and
devilish, and are shut out from the
e presence of God.
50 But God hath made known
unto our fathers that all men must
repent.
51 And he called upon our father
Adam by his own voice, saying: I am
God; I a made the world, and b men c before they were in the flesh.
52 And he also said unto him: If
thou wilt turn unto me, and hearken unto my voice, and believe, and
repent of all thy transgressions, and
be a baptized, even in water, in the
name of mine Only Begotten Son,
who is full of b grace and truth,
which is c Jesus Christ, the only d name which shall be given under
heaven, whereby e salvation shall
come unto the children of men, ye
shall receive the gift of the Holy
Ghost, asking all things in his name,
and whatsoever ye shall ask, it shall
be given you.

the Lord, and said: Why is it that
men must repent and be baptized
in water? And the Lord said unto
Adam: Behold I have a forgiven thee
thy transgression in the Garden
of Eden.
54 Hence came the saying abroad
among the people, that the a Son of
God hath b atoned for original guilt,
wherein the sins of the parents cannot
be answered upon the heads of the
c children, for they are d whole from
the foundation of the world.55 And the Lord spake unto Adam,
saying: Inasmuch as thy children are
a conceived in sin, even so when they
begin to grow up, b sin conceiveth
in their hearts, and they taste the
c bitter, that they may know to prize
the good.
56 And it is given unto them to know
good from evil; wherefore they are
a agents unto themselves, and I have
given unto you another law and
commandment.
57 Wherefore teach it unto your chil- dren, that all men, everywhere, must
a repent, or they can in nowise inherit
the kingdom of God, for no b unclean
thing can dwell there, or c dwell in
his d presence; for, in the language of
Adam, e Man of Holiness is his name,
and the name of his Only Begotten is
the f Son of Man, even g Jesus Christ,
a righteous h Judge, who shall come
in the meridian of time.
58 Therefore I give unto you a a commandment, to b teach these things
freely unto your c children, saying:
59 That by reason of transgression
cometh the fall, which fall bringeth
death, and inasmuch as ye were born
into the world by water, and blood,
and the a spirit, which I have made,
and so became of b dust a living soul,
even so ye must be c born again into
the kingdom of heaven, of d water,
and of the Spirit, and be cleansed by
blood, even the blood of mine Only
Begotten; that ye might be sanctified
from all sin, and e enjoy the f words of g eternal life in this world, and eternal life in the world to come, even
immortal h glory;
60 For by the a water ye keep the
commandment; by the Spirit ye are
b justified, and by the c blood ye are d sanctified;
61 Therefore it is given to abide
in you; the a record of heaven; the b Comforter; the c peaceable things
of immortal glory; the truth of
all things; that which quickeneth
all things, which maketh alive all
things; that which knoweth all
things, and hath all d power according

62 And now, behold, I say unto you:
This is the a plan of salvation unto
all men, through the b blood of mine c Only Begotten, who shall come in
the meridian of time.
63 And behold, all things have
their a likeness, and all things are
created and made to b bear record of
me, both things which are temporal,
and things which are spiritual; things
which are in the heavens above,
and things which are on the earth,
and things which are in the earth, and
things which are under the earth,
both above and beneath: all things
bear record of me.64 And it came to pass, when the
Lord had spoken with Adam, our
father, that Adam cried unto the
Lord, and he was a caught away by
the Spirit of the Lord, and was carried
down into the water, and was laid
under the b water, and was brought
forth out of the water.
65 And thus he was baptized, and
the Spirit of God descended upon
him, and thus he was a born of the
Spirit, and became quickened in the
b inner man.
66 And he heard a voice out of
heaven, saying: Thou art baptized
with a fire, and with the Holy Ghost.
This is the b record of the Father, and
the Son, from henceforth and forever;
67 And thou art after the a order of
him who was without beginning of
days or end of years, from all eter- nity to all eternity.
68 Behold, thou art a one in me, a
son of God; and thus may all become
my b sons. Amen.
Chapter 7
(December 1830)
Enoch teaches, leads the people, and
moves mountains—The city of Zion is
established—Enoch foresees the coming of the Son of Man, His atoning
sacrifice, and the resurrection of the
Saints—He foresees the Restoration,
the Gathering, the Second Coming, and
the return of Zion.
And it came to pass that Enoch con- tinued his speech, saying: Behold, our
father Adam taught these things, and
many have believed and become the
a sons of God, and many have believed
not, and have perished in their sins,
and are looking forth with b fear, in
torment, for the fiery indignation of
the wrath of God to be poured out
upon them.2 And from that time forth Enoch
began to prophesy, saying unto the
people, that: As I was journeying,
and stood upon the place Mahujah,
and cried unto the Lord, there came
a voice out of heaven, saying—Turn
ye, and get ye upon the mount
a Simeon.3 And it came to pass that I turned
and went up on the mount; and as I
stood upon the mount, I beheld the
heavens open, and I was clothed upon
with a glory;
4 And I a saw the Lord; and he
stood before my face, and he talked
with me, even as a man talketh one
with another, b face to face; and he

said unto me: c Look, and I will d show
unto thee the world for the space of
many generations.
5 And it came to pass that I beheld
in the valley of Shum, and lo, a great
people which dwelt in a tents, which
were the people of Shum.
6 And again the Lord said unto me:
Look; and I looked towards the north,
and I beheld the people of a Canaan,
which dwelt in tents.
7 And the Lord said unto me:
Prophesy; and I prophesied, saying:
Behold the people of Canaan, which
are numerous, shall go forth in battle array against the people of Shum,
and shall slay them that they shall
utterly be destroyed; and the people
of Canaan shall divide themselves in
the land, and the land shall be barren and unfruitful, and none other
people shall dwell there but the people of Canaan;
8 For behold, the Lord shall a curse
the land with much heat, and the
b barrenness thereof shall go forth
forever; and there was a c blackness
came upon all the children of Canaan,
that they were despised among all
people.9 And it came to pass that the Lord
said unto me: Look; and I looked, and
I beheld the land of Sharon, and the
land of Enoch, and the land of Omner,
and the land of Heni, and the land
of Shem, and the land of Haner, and
the land of Hanannihah, and all the
inhabitants thereof;
10 And the Lord said unto me: Go
to this people, and say unto them— a Repent, lest I come out and smite
them with a curse, and they die.
11 And he gave unto me a com- mandment that I should a baptize
in the name of the Father, and of
the Son, which is full of b grace and
truth, and of the Holy Ghost, which
beareth record of the Father and
the Son.
12 And it came to pass that Enoch
continued to call upon all the people,
save it were the people of Canaan,
to repent;
13 And so great was the a faith of
Enoch that he led the people of God,
and their enemies came to battle
against them; and he b spake the word
of the Lord, and the earth trembled,
and the c mountains fled, even according to his command; and the d rivers
of water were turned out of their
course; and the roar of the lions was
heard out of the wilderness; and all
nations feared greatly, so e powerful
was the word of Enoch, and so great
was the power of the language which
God had given him.14 There also came a up a land out
of the depth of the sea, and so great
was the fear of the enemies of the
people of God, that they fled and
stood afar off and went upon the land
which came up out of the depth of
the sea.
15 And the a giants of the land, also,
stood afar off; and there went forth
a b curse upon all people that fought
against God;
16 And from that time forth there
were wars and bloodshed among
them; but the Lord came and a dwelt
with his people, and they dwelt in
righteousness.
17 The a fear of the Lord was upon
all nations, so great was the b glory of
the Lord, which was upon his people.
And the Lord blessed the c land, and
they were blessed upon the mountains, and upon the high places, and
did flourish.

18 And the Lord called his people a Zion, because they were of b one
heart and one mind, and dwelt in
righteousness; and there was no poor
among them.19 And Enoch continued his preaching in righteousness unto the people
of God. And it came to pass in his
days, that he built a city that was
called the City of Holiness, even Zion.
20 And it came to pass that Enoch
talked with the Lord; and he said
unto the Lord: Surely a Zion shall
dwell in safety forever. But the Lord
said unto Enoch: Zion have I blessed,
but the b residue of the people have
I cursed.
21 And it came to pass that the Lord
showed unto Enoch all the inhabitants of the earth; and he beheld,
and lo, a Zion, in process of time,
was b taken up into heaven. And the
Lord said unto Enoch: Behold mine
abode forever.
22 And Enoch also beheld the residue of the people which were the
sons of Adam; and they were a mix- ture of all the seed of Adam save it
was the seed of Cain, for the seed of
Cain were a black, and had not place
among them.
23 And after that Zion was taken
up into a heaven, Enoch b beheld, and
lo, c all the nations of the earth were
before him;
24 And there came generation upon
generation; and Enoch was high and
a lifted up, even in the bosom of the
Father, and of the Son of Man; and
behold, the power of Satan was upon
all the face of the earth.25 And he saw angels descending
out of heaven; and he heard a loud
voice saying: Wo, wo be unto the inhabitants of the earth.
26 And he beheld Satan; and he
had a great a chain in his hand, and
it veiled the whole face of the earth
with b darkness; and he looked up and c laughed, and his d angels rejoiced.
27 And Enoch beheld a angels descending out of heaven, bearing b testimony of the Father and Son; and
the Holy Ghost fell on many, and
they were caught up by the powers
of heaven into Zion.28 And it came to pass that the God
of heaven looked upon the a residue
of the people, and he wept; and
Enoch bore record of it, saying:
How is it that the heavens weep, and
shed forth their tears as the rain upon
the mountains?
29 And Enoch said unto the Lord:
How is it that thou canst a weep, seeing thou art holy, and from all eternity to all eternity ?
30 And were it possible that man
could number the particles of the
earth, yea, millions of a earths like
this, it would not be a beginning to
the number of thy b creations; and
thy curtains are stretched out still;
and yet thou art there, and thy bosom is there; and also thou art just;
thou art merciful and kind forever;
31 And thou hast taken a Zion to
thine own bosom, from all thy creations, from all eternity to all eternity; and naught but peace, b justice,
and truth is the habitation of thy
throne; and mercy shall go before
thy face and have no end; how is it
thou canst c weep?

32 The Lord said unto Enoch: Behold
these thy brethren; they are the
workmanship of mine own a hands,
and I gave unto them their b knowledge, in the day I created them; and
in the Garden of Eden, gave I unto
man his c agency;
33 And unto thy brethren have I
said, and also given commandment,
that they should a love one another,
and that they should choose me,
their Father; but behold, they are
without affection, and they b hate
their own blood;
34 And the a fire of mine b indignation is kindled against them; and in
my hot displeasure will I send in the
c floods upon them, for my fierce anger is kindled against them.
35 Behold, I am God; a Man of
Holiness is my name; Man of Counsel
is my name; and Endless and Eternal
is my b name, also.
36 Wherefore, I can stretch forth
mine hands and hold all the a creations which I have made; and mine
eye can pierce them also, and among
all the workmanship of mine hands
there has not been so great b wickedness as among thy brethren.37 But behold, their sins shall be
upon the heads of their fathers;
Satan shall be their father, and misery
shall be their doom; and the whole
heavens shall weep over them, even
all the workmanship of mine hands;
wherefore should not the heavens
weep, seeing these shall suffer?
38 But behold, these which thine
eyes are upon shall perish in the
floods; and behold, I will shut
them up; a a prison have I prepared
for them.
39 And a that which I have chosen
hath pled before my face. Wherefore,
he b suffereth for their sins; inasmuch
as they will repent in the day that
my c Chosen shall return unto me,
and until that day they shall be in
d torment;
40 Wherefore, for this shall the
heavens weep, yea, and all the workmanship of mine hands.
41 And it came to pass that the
Lord spake unto Enoch, and a told
Enoch all the doings of the children
of men; wherefore Enoch knew,
and looked upon their wickedness,
and their misery, and wept and
stretched forth his arms, and his
b heart swelled wide as eternity; and
his bowels yearned; and all eternity
shook.
42 And Enoch also saw Noah, and
his a family; that the posterity of all
the sons of Noah should be saved
with a temporal salvation;
43 Wherefore Enoch saw that Noah
built an a ark; and that the Lord
smiled upon it, and held it in his own
hand; but upon the residue of the
wicked the b floods came and swallowed them up.44 And as Enoch saw this, he had a bitterness of soul, and wept over
his brethren, and said unto the
heavens: I will refuse to be b comforted; but the Lord said unto Enoch:
Lift up your heart, and be glad;
and look.
45 And it came to pass that Enoch
looked; and from Noah, he beheld
all the families of the earth; and he
cried unto the Lord, saying: When
shall the day of the Lord come? When
shall the blood of the Righteous be

shed, that all they that mourn may
be a sanctified and have eternal
life?
46 And the Lord said: It shall be in
the a meridian of time, in the days of
wickedness and vengeance.
47 And behold, Enoch a saw the day
of the coming of the Son of Man,
even in the flesh; and his soul rejoiced, saying: The Righteous is lifted
up, and the b Lamb is slain from the
foundation of the world; and through
c faith I am in the bosom of the Father,
and behold, d Zion is with me.
48 And it came to pass that Enoch
looked upon the a earth; and he heard
a voice from the bowels thereof,
saying: Wo, wo is me, the mother
of men; I am b pained, I am weary,
because of the wickedness of my
children. When shall I c rest, and be d cleansed from the e filthiness which
is gone forth out of me? When will
my Creator sanctify me, that I may
rest, and righteousness for a season
abide upon my face?
49 And when Enoch heard the earth
mourn, he wept, and cried unto the
Lord, saying: O Lord, wilt thou not
have compassion upon the earth?
Wilt thou not bless the children
of Noah?
50 And it came to pass that Enoch
continued his cry unto the Lord, saying: I ask thee, O Lord, in the name
of thine Only Begotten, even Jesus
Christ, that thou wilt have mercy
upon Noah and his seed, that the
earth might never more be covered
by the a floods.
51 And the Lord could not withhold;
and he a covenanted with Enoch,
and sware unto him with an oath,
that he would stay the b floods; that
he would call upon the children
of Noah;
52 And he sent forth an unalter- able decree, that a a remnant of his
seed should always be found among
all nations, while the earth should
stand;
53 And the Lord said: Blessed is
he through whose seed Messiah
shall come; for he saith—I am
a Messiah, the b King of Zion, the c Rock of Heaven, which is broad as
d eternity; whoso cometh in at the
gate and e climbeth up by me shall
never fall; wherefore, blessed are
they of whom I have spoken, for
they shall come forth with f songs of
everlasting g joy.
54 And it came to pass that Enoch
cried unto the Lord, saying: When
the Son of Man cometh in the flesh,
shall the earth rest? I pray thee, show
me these things.
55 And the Lord said unto Enoch:
Look, and he looked and beheld the
a Son of Man lifted up on the b cross,
after the manner of men;
56 And he heard a loud voice; and
the heavens were a veiled; and all the
creations of God mourned; and
the earth b groaned; and the rocks
were rent; and the c saints arose, and
were d crowned at the e right hand
of the Son of Man, with crowns
of glory;
57 And as many of the a spirits as
were in b prison came forth, and
stood on the right hand of God; and

the remainder were reserved in
chains of darkness until the judgment of the great day.
58 And again Enoch wept and cried
unto the Lord, saying: When shall
the earth a rest?
59 And Enoch beheld the Son of
Man ascend up unto the Father;
and he called unto the Lord, saying:
Wilt thou not come again upon the
earth? Forasmuch as thou art God,
and I know thee, and thou hast sworn
unto me, and commanded me that
I should ask in the name of thine
Only Begotten; thou hast made me,
and given unto me a right to thy
throne, and not of myself, but through
thine own grace; wherefore, I ask
thee if thou wilt not come again on
the earth.
60 And the Lord said unto Enoch: As
I live, even so will I come in the a last
days, in the days of wickedness and
vengeance, to fulfil the b oath which
I have made unto you concerning
the children of Noah;
61 And the day shall come that the
earth shall a rest, but before that day
the heavens shall be b darkened, and
a c veil of darkness shall cover the
earth; and the heavens shall shake,
and also the earth; and great tribu- lations shall be among the children of men, but my people will I
d preserve;
62 And a righteousness will I send
down out of heaven; and truth will
I send forth out of the earth, to bear
b testimony of mine Only Begotten;
his c resurrection from the dead; yea,
and also the resurrection of all men;
and righteousness and truth will
I cause to sweep the earth as with
a flood, to d gather out mine elect
from the four quarters of the earth,
unto a place which I shall prepare,
an Holy City, that my people may
gird up their loins, and be looking
forth for the time of my coming;
for there shall be my tabernacle,
and it shall be called e Zion, a f  New
Jerusalem.
63 And the Lord said unto Enoch:
Then shalt thou and all thy a city
meet them there, and we will b receive
them into our bosom, and they shall
see us; and we will fall upon their
necks, and they shall fall upon our
necks, and we will kiss each other;
64 And there shall be mine abode,
and it shall be Zion, which shall
come forth out of all the creations
which I have made; and for the
space of a a thousand years the b earth
shall c rest.
65 And it came to pass that Enoch
saw the a day of the b coming of the
Son of Man, in the last days, to dwell
on the earth in righteousness for the
space of a thousand years;
66 But before that day he saw great
tribulations among the wicked; and
he also saw the sea, that it was troubled, and men’s hearts a failing them,
looking forth with fear for the b judg- ments of the Almighty God, which
should come upon the wicked.
67 And the Lord showed Enoch
all things, even unto the end of the
world; and he saw the day of the
righteous, the hour of their redemption, and received a fulness of a joy;
68 And all the days of a Zion, in the
days of Enoch, were three hundred
and sixty-five years.69 And Enoch and all his people a walked with God, and he dwelt in
the midst of Zion; and it came to

Chapter 8
(February 1831)
Methuselah prophesies—Noah and his
sons preach the gospel—Great wickedness prevails—The call to repentance is
unheeded—God decrees the destruction
of all flesh by the Flood.
And all the days of a Enoch were
four hundred and thirty years.
2 And it came to pass that
Methuselah, the son of Enoch, was
a not taken, that the covenants of
the Lord might be fulfilled, which
he made to Enoch; for he truly
covenanted with Enoch that Noah
should be of the fruit of his loins.3 And it came to pass that Methuselah a prophesied that from his loins
should spring all the kingdoms of the
earth (through Noah), and he took
glory unto himself.4 And there came forth a great a famine into the land, and the Lord
b cursed the earth with a sore curse,
and many of the inhabitants thereof
died.5 And it came to pass that Methuselah lived one hundred and eightyseven years, and begat Lamech;
6 And Methuselah lived, after he
begat Lamech, seven hundred and
eighty-two years, and begat sons and
daughters;
7 And all the days of Methuselah
were nine hundred and sixty-nine
years, and he died.
8 And Lamech lived one hundred
and eighty-two years, and begat
a son,
9 And he called his name Noah,
saying: This son shall comfort us
concerning our work and toil of our
hands, because of the ground which
the Lord hath a cursed.
10 And Lamech lived, after he be- gat Noah, five hundred and ninetyfive years, and begat sons and
daughters;
11 And all the days of Lamech were
seven hundred and seventy-seven
years, and he died.
12 And Noah was four hundred
and fifty years old, and a begat Ja- pheth; and forty-two years afterward
he begat b Shem of her who was the
mother of Japheth, and when he
was five hundred years old he begat
c Ham.
13 And a Noah and his sons hearkened unto the Lord, and gave heed,
and they were called the b sons of
God.
14 And when these men began to
multiply on the face of the earth, and
daughters were born unto them, the
a sons of men saw that those daughters were fair, and they took them
b wives, even as they chose.15 And the Lord said unto Noah:
The daughters of thy sons have sold
themselves; for behold mine anger is kindled against the sons of
men, for they will not a hearken to
my voice.
16 And it came to pass that
Noah a prophesied, and taught the
things of God, even as it was in the
beginning.
17 And the Lord said unto Noah:
My Spirit shall not always a strive
with man, for he shall know that all
b flesh shall die; yet his days shall be
an c hundred and twenty years; and
if men do not repent, I will send in
the d floods upon them.

a giants on the earth, and they sought
Noah to take away his b life; but the
Lord was with Noah, and the c power
of the Lord was upon him.
19 And the Lord a ordained b Noah
after his own c order, and commanded
him that he should go forth and d declare his Gospel unto the children of
men, even as it was given unto Enoch.
20 And it came to pass that Noah
called upon the children of men that
they should a repent; but they hearkened not unto his words;
21 And also, after that they had
heard him, they came up before
him, saying: Behold, we are the sons
of God; have we not taken unto ourselves the daughters of men? And
are we not a eating and drinking, and
marrying and giving in marriage?
And our wives bear unto us children, and the same are mighty men,
which are like unto men of old, men
of great renown. And they hearkened
not unto the words of Noah.
22 And God saw that the a wickedness of men had become great
in the earth; and every man was
lifted up in the b imagination of the
thoughts of his heart, being only
evil continually.
23 And it came to pass that Noah
continued his a preaching unto the
people, saying: Hearken, and give
heed unto my words;
24 a Believe and repent of your sins
and be b baptized in the name of
Jesus Christ, the Son of God, even
as our fathers, and ye shall receive
the Holy Ghost, that ye may have
all things made c manifest; and if ye
do not this, the floods will come in
upon you; nevertheless they hearkened not.
25 And it a repented Noah, and
his heart was pained that the Lord
had made man on the earth, and it
grieved him at the heart.
26 And the Lord said: I will a destroy man whom I have created, from
the face of the earth, both man and
beast, and the creeping things, and
the fowls of the air; for it repenteth
Noah that I have created them, and
that I have made them; and he hath
called upon me; for they have sought
his b life.
27 And thus Noah found a grace in
the eyes of the Lord; for Noah was a
just man, and b perfect in his generation; and he c walked with God, as
did also his three sons, Shem, Ham,
and Japheth.
28 The a earth was b corrupt before
God, and it was filled with violence.29 And God looked upon the earth,
and, behold, it was corrupt, for all
flesh had corrupted its a way upon
the earth.30 And God said unto Noah: The
end of all flesh is come before me,
for the earth is filled with violence,
and behold I will a destroy all flesh
from off the earth.

Chapter 1
Abraham seeks the blessings of the patriarchal order—He is persecuted by
false priests in Chaldea—Jehovah saves
him—The origins and government of
Egypt are reviewed.
I
n the land of the a Chaldeans, at
the residence of my fathers, I,
b Abraham, saw that it was needful for me to obtain another place
of c residence;
2 And, finding there was greater a happiness and peace and rest for
me, I sought for the blessings of the
fathers, and the right whereunto I
should be ordained to administer the
same; having been myself a follower
of b righteousness, desiring also to
be one who possessed great c knowl- edge, and to be a greater follower of
righteousness, and to possess a greater
knowledge, and to be a father of
many d nations, a prince of peace,
and e desiring to receive instructions,
and to keep the commandments of
God, I became a rightful heir, a f  High
Priest, holding the right belonging
to the fathers.
3 It was a conferred upon me from
the fathers; it came down from the
fathers, from the beginning of time,
yea, even from the beginning, or
before the foundation of the earth,
down to the present time, even the
right of the b firstborn, or the first
man, who is c Adam, or first father,
through the fathers unto me.
4 I sought for mine a appointment
unto the Priesthood according to the
appointment of God unto the b fathers
concerning the seed.
5 My a fathers, having turned from
their righteousness, and from the
holy commandments which the Lord
their God had given unto them, unto
the worshiping of the b gods of the c heathen, utterly refused to hearken
to my voice;
6 For their a hearts were set to do b evil, and were wholly turned to
the god of c Elkenah, and the god of
Libnah, and the god of Mahmackrah,
and the god of Korash, and the god
of Pharaoh, king of Egypt;
7 Therefore they turned their
hearts to the sacrifice of the a heathen
in offering up their children unto
these dumb idols, and hearkened not
unto my voice, but endeavored to

The Book of Abraham
Translated from the Papyrus, by Joseph Smith
A Translation of some ancient Records that have fallen into our hands from the catacombs of Egypt. The writings of Abraham while he was in Egypt, called the Book of
Abraham, written by his own hand, upon papyrus.
Abraham 1:8–19 30
take away my b life by the hand of
the priest of Elkenah. The priest
of Elkenah was also the priest of
Pharaoh.
8 Now, at this time it was the custom of the priest of Pharaoh, the
king of Egypt, to offer up upon the
altar which was built in the land
of Chaldea, for the offering unto
these strange gods, men, women,
and children.
9 And it came to pass that the
priest made an offering unto the god
of Pharaoh, and also unto the god of
Shagreel, even after the manner of
the Egyptians. Now the god of
Shagreel was the sun.10 Even the thank-offering of a
child did the a priest of Pharaoh offer upon the altar which stood by
the hill called Potiphar’s Hill, at the
head of the plain of Olishem.11 Now, this priest had offered upon
this altar three virgins at one time,
who were the daughters of Onitah,
one of the royal descent directly from
the loins of a Ham. These virgins were
offered up because of their virtue;
they would not b bow down to worship gods of wood or of stone, there- fore they were killed upon this altar,
and it was done after the manner of
the Egyptians.12 And it came to pass that the
priests laid violence upon me, that
they might slay me also, as they did
those virgins upon this altar; and
that you may have a knowledge of
this altar, I will refer you to the representation at the commencement
of this record.13 It was made after the form of
a bedstead, such as was had among
the Chaldeans, and it stood before the gods of Elkenah, Libnah,
Mahmackrah, Korash, and also a
god like unto that of Pharaoh, king
of Egypt.
14 That you may have an un- derstanding of these gods, I have
given you the fashion of them in
the figures at the beginning, which
manner of figures is called by the
Chaldeans Rahleenos, which signi- fies hieroglyphics.
15 And as they lifted up their hands
upon me, that they might offer me
up and take away my life, behold, I
lifted up my voice unto the Lord my
God, and the Lord a hearkened and
heard, and he filled me with the vision of the Almighty, and the angel
of his presence stood by me, and
immediately b unloosed my bands;
16 And his voice was unto me: a Abraham, Abraham, behold, my
b name is Jehovah, and I have heard
thee, and have come down to deliver
thee, and to take thee away from
thy c father’s house, and from all thy
kinsfolk, into a strange d land which
thou knowest not of;
17 And this because they have
turned their a hearts away from me,
to worship the god of Elkenah, and
the god of Libnah, and the god of
Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash,
and the god of Pharaoh, king of
Egypt; therefore I have come down
to b visit them, and to destroy him
who hath lifted up his hand against
thee, Abraham, my son, to take away
thy life.
18 Behold, I will lead thee by my
hand, and I will take thee, to put upon
thee my name, even the Priesthood
of thy father, and my power shall
be over thee.
19 As it was with a Noah so shall it
be with thee; but through thy ministry my b name shall be known in
the earth c forever, for I am thy God.

20 Behold, Potiphar’s Hill was in
the land of a Ur, of Chaldea. And
the Lord broke down the altar of
Elkenah, and of the gods of the
land, and utterly destroyed them,
and smote the priest that he died;
and there was great mourning in
Chaldea, and also in the court of
Pharaoh; which Pharaoh signifies
king by royal blood.
21 Now this king of Egypt was a
descendant from the a loins of b Ham,
and was a partaker of the blood of
the c Canaanites by birth.
22 From this descent sprang all
the Egyptians, and thus the blood
of the a Canaanites was preserved
in the land.
23 The land of a Egypt being first
discovered by a woman, who was the
daughter of Ham, and the daughter
of Egyptus, which in the Chaldean
signifies Egypt, which signifies that
which is forbidden;
24 When this woman discovered
the land it was under water, who
afterward settled her sons in it; and
thus, from Ham, sprang that race
which preserved the curse in the
land.25 Now the first a government of
Egypt was established by Pharaoh,
the eldest son of Egyptus, the daughter of Ham, and it was after the
manner of the government of Ham,
which was patriarchal.
26 Pharaoh, being a righteous man,
established his kingdom and judged
his people wisely and justly all his
days, seeking earnestly to imitate
that a order established by the fathers
in the first generations, in the days
of the first patriarchal reign, even
in the reign of Adam, and also of
Noah, his father, who blessed him
with the b blessings of the earth,
and with the blessings of wisdom,
but cursed him as pertaining to the
Priesthood.27 Now, Pharaoh being of that lineage by which he could not have
the right of a Priesthood, notwithstanding the Pharaohs would fain
b claim it from Noah, through Ham,
therefore my father was led away by
their idolatry;
28 But I shall endeavor, hereafter,
to delineate the chronology running
back from myself to the beginning
of the creation, for the a records have
come into my hands, which I hold
unto this present time.29 Now, after the priest of Elkenah
was smitten that he died, there came
a fulfilment of those things which
were said unto me concerning the
land of Chaldea, that there should
be a a famine in the land.
30 Accordingly a famine prevailed
throughout all the land of Chaldea,
and my father was sorely tormented
because of the famine, and he re- pented of the evil which he had determined against me, to take away
my a life.
31 But the a records of the fathers,
even the patriarchs, concerning the
right of Priesthood, the Lord my
God preserved in mine own hands;
therefore a knowledge of the begin- ning of the creation, and also of the
b planets, and of the stars, as they
were made known unto the fathers,
have I kept even unto this day, and I
shall endeavor to write some of these
things upon this c record, for the benefit of my posterity that shall come
after me.

Abraham 2:1–10 32
Chapter 2
Abraham leaves Ur to go to Canaan—
Jehovah appears to him at Haran—All
gospel blessings are promised to his seed
and through his seed to all—He goes
to Canaan and on to Egypt.
Now the Lord God caused the a famine to wax sore in the land of Ur,
insomuch that b Haran, my brother, died; but c Terah, my father,
yet lived in the land of Ur, of the
Chaldees.
2 And it came to pass that I, Abra- ham, took a Sarai to wife, and b Nahor,
my brother, took Milcah to wife, who
was the c daughter of Haran.3 Now the Lord had a said unto me:
Abraham, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from
thy father’s house, unto a land that
I will show thee.4 Therefore I left the land of a Ur,
of the Chaldees, to go into the land
of Canaan; and I took Lot, my brother’s son, and his wife, and Sarai my
wife; and also my b father followed
after me, unto the land which we
denominated Haran.
5 And the famine abated; and my
father tarried in Haran and dwelt
there, as there were many flocks in
Haran; and my father turned again
unto his a idolatry, therefore he continued in Haran.
6 But I, Abraham, and Lot, my
brother’s son, prayed unto the Lord,
and the Lord a appeared unto me,
and said unto me: Arise, and take
Lot with thee; for I have purposed
to take thee away out of Haran, and
to make of thee a b minister to bear
my c name in a strange d land which
I will give unto thy seed after thee
for an everlasting possession, when
they hearken to my voice.
7 For I am the Lord thy God; I dwell
in a heaven; the earth is my b footstool; I stretch my hand over the sea,
and it obeys my voice; I cause the
wind and the fire to be my c chariot; I say to the mountains—Depart
hence—and behold, they are taken
away by a whirlwind, in an instant,
suddenly.
8 My a name is Jehovah, and I b know
the end from the beginning; therefore
my hand shall be over thee.
9 And I will make of thee a great a nation, and I will b bless thee above
measure, and make thy name great
among all nations, and thou shalt be
a blessing unto thy seed after thee,
that in their hands they shall bear
this ministry and c Priesthood unto
all nations;
10 And I will a bless them through
thy name; for as many as receive
this b Gospel shall be called after thy c name, and shall be accounted thy
d seed, and shall rise up and bless
thee, as their e father;

11 And I will a bless them that bless
thee, and b curse them that curse
thee; and in thee (that is, in thy
Priesthood) and in thy c seed (that is,
thy Priesthood), for I give unto thee
a promise that this d right shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after
thee (that is to say, the literal seed,
or the seed of the body) shall all the
families of the earth be blessed, even
with the blessings of the Gospel,
which are the blessings of salvation,
even of life eternal.12 Now, after the Lord had withdrawn from speaking to me, and
withdrawn his face from me, I said
in my heart: Thy servant has a sought
thee earnestly; now I have found
thee;
13 Thou didst send thine angel to a deliver me from the gods of Elkenah,
and I will do well to hearken unto
thy voice, therefore let thy servant
rise up and depart in peace.14 So I, Abraham, departed as the
Lord had said unto me, and Lot with
me; and I, Abraham, was a sixty and
two years old when I departed out
of Haran.
15 And I took Sarai, whom I took to
wife when I was in Ur, in Chaldea,
and Lot, my brother’s son, and all
our substance that we had gathered,
and the souls that we had a won in
Haran, and came forth in the way
to the land of Canaan, and dwelt in
tents as we came on our way;
16 Therefore, a eternity was our
covering and our b rock and our sal- vation, as we journeyed from Haran
by the way of c Jershon, to come to
the land of Canaan.
17 Now I, Abraham, built an a altar
in the land of Jershon, and made an
offering unto the Lord, and prayed
that the b famine might be turned
away from my father’s house, that
they might not perish.
18 And then we passed from Jershon
through the land unto the place
of Sechem; it was situated in the
plains of Moreh, and we had already come into the borders of the
land of the a Canaanites, and I offered b sacrifice there in the plains
of Moreh, and called on the Lord
devoutly, because we had already
come into the land of this idolatrous
nation.19 And the Lord a appeared unto
me in answer to my prayers, and
said unto me: Unto thy seed will I
give this b land.
20 And I, Abraham, arose from the
place of the altar which I had built
unto the Lord, and removed from
thence unto a mountain on the east
of a Bethel, and pitched my tent there,
Bethel on the west, and b Hai on the
east; and there I built another c altar
unto the Lord, and d called again upon
the name of the Lord.21 And I, Abraham, journeyed, going on still towards the south; and
there was a continuation of a famine
in the land; and I, Abraham, concluded
to go down into Egypt, to sojourn
there, for the famine became very
grievous.
22 And it came to pass when I was
come near to enter into Egypt, the
Lord a said unto me: Behold, Sarai,
thy wife, is a very fair woman to
look upon;

when the Egyptians shall see her,
they will say—She is his wife; and
they will kill you, but they will save
her alive; therefore see that ye do on
this wise:
24 Let her say unto the Egyptians,
she is thy sister, and thy soul shall live.
25 And it came to pass that I,
Abraham, told Sarai, my wife, all
that the Lord had said unto me—
Therefore say unto them, I pray thee,
thou art my a sister, that it may be
well with me for thy sake, and my
soul shall live because of thee.
Chapter 3
Abraham learns about the sun, moon,
and stars by means of the Urim and
Thummim—The Lord reveals to him
the eternal nature of spirits—He learns
of pre-earth life, foreordination, the
Creation, the choosing of a Redeemer,
and the second estate of man.
And I, Abraham, had the a Urim and
Thummim, which the Lord my God
had given unto me, in Ur of the
Chaldees;
2 And I saw the a stars, that they were
very great, and that one of them was
nearest unto the throne of God; and
there were many great ones which
were near unto it;
3 And the Lord said unto me: These
are the governing ones; and the name
of the great one is a Kolob, because
it is near unto me, for I am the Lord
thy God: I have set this one to gov- ern all those which belong to the
same order as that upon which thou
standest.
4 And the Lord said unto me, by
the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob
was after the manner of the Lord,
according to its a times and seasons
in the revolutions thereof; that one
revolution was a b day unto the Lord,
after his manner of reckoning, it
being one thousand c years according to the time appointed unto that
whereon thou standest. This is the
reckoning of the Lord’s d time, according to the reckoning of Kolob.
5 And the Lord said unto me: The
planet which is the lesser light, lesser
than that which is to rule the day,
even the night, is above or a greater
than that upon which thou standest
in point of reckoning, for it moveth
in order more slow; this is in order
because it standeth above the earth
upon which thou standest, therefore
the reckoning of its time is not so
many as to its number of days, and
of months, and of years.
6 And the Lord said unto me: Now,
Abraham, these a two facts exist, behold thine eyes see it; it is given unto
thee to know the times of reckoning,
and the set time, yea, the set time of
the earth upon which thou standest,
and the set time of the greater light
which is set to rule the day, and the
set time of the lesser light which is
set to rule the night.
7 Now the set time of the lesser light
is a longer time as to its reckoning
than the reckoning of the time of
the earth upon which thou standest.
8 And where these two facts exist,
there shall be another fact above
them, that is, there shall be another
planet whose reckoning of time shall
be longer still;
9 And thus there shall be the reckoning of the time of one a planet
above another, until thou come nigh
unto Kolob, which Kolob is after the
reckoning of the Lord’s time; which
Kolob is set nigh unto the throne
of God, to govern all those planets
which belong to the same b order as
that upon which thou standest.

10 And it is given unto thee to know
the set time of all the stars that are
set to give light, until thou come near
unto the throne of God.
11 Thus I, Abraham, a talked with the
Lord, face to face, as one man talketh
with another; and he told me of the
works which his hands had made;
12 And he said unto me: My son,
my son (and his hand was stretched
out), behold I will show you all these.
And he put his hand upon mine
eyes, and I saw those things which
his hands had made, which were
many; and they multiplied before
mine eyes, and I could not see the
end thereof.
13 And he said unto me: This is
Shinehah, which is the sun. And he
said unto me: Kokob, which is star.
And he said unto me: Olea, which
is the moon. And he said unto me:
Kokaubeam, which signifies stars,
or all the great lights, which were
in the firmament of heaven.
14 And it was in the night time
when the Lord spake these words
unto me: I will a multiply thee, and
thy b seed after thee, like unto these;
and if thou canst count the c number
of sands, so shall be the number of
thy seeds.15 And the Lord said unto me:
Abraham, I a show these things unto
thee before ye go into Egypt, that ye
may declare all these words.
16 If a two things exist, and there
be one above the other, there shall
be greater things above them; there- fore b Kolob is the greatest of all the
Kokaubeam that thou hast seen, because it is nearest unto me.
17 Now, if there be two things, one
above the other, and the moon be
above the earth, then it may be that
a planet or a star may exist above it;
and there is nothing that the Lord
thy God shall take in his heart to do
but what he will a do it.
18 Howbeit that he made the greater
star; as, also, if there be two a spirits,
and one shall be more intelligent than
the other, yet these two spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent
than the other, have no beginning;
they existed before, they shall have
no end, they shall exist after, for they
are b gnolaum, or eternal.
19 And the Lord said unto me:
These two facts do exist, that there
are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be
another more intelligent than they;
I am the Lord thy God, I am a more
intelligent than they all.
20 The Lord thy God sent his angel
to a deliver thee from the hands of
the priest of Elkenah.
21 I dwell in the midst of them all; I
now, therefore, have come down unto
thee to declare unto thee the a works
which my hands have made, wherein
my b wisdom excelleth them all, for
I c rule in the heavens above, and in
the earth beneath, in all wisdom and
prudence, over all the intelligences
thine eyes have seen from the beginning; I came down in the beginning
in the midst of all the intelligences
thou hast seen.

Explanation
Fig. 1. Kolob, signifying the first creation, nearest to the celestial, or the residence of
God. First in government, the last pertaining to the measurement of time. The measurement according to celestial time, which celestial time signifies one day to a cubit. One day
in Kolob is equal to a thousand years according to the measurement of this earth, which is
called by the Egyptians Jah-oh-eh.
Fig. 2. Stands next to Kolob, called by the Egyptians Oliblish, which is the next grand
governing creation near to the celestial or the place where God resides; holding the key of
power also, pertaining to other planets; as revealed from God to Abraham, as he offered
sacrifice upon an altar, which he had built unto the Lord.
Fig. 3. Is made to represent God, sitting upon his throne, clothed with power and authority; with a crown of eternal light upon his head; representing also the grand Key-words
of the Holy Priesthood, as revealed to Adam in the Garden of Eden, as also to Seth, Noah,
Melchizedek, Abraham, and all to whom the Priesthood was revealed.
Fig. 4. Answers to the Hebrew word Raukeeyang, signifying expanse, or the firmament
of the heavens; also a numerical figure, in Egyptian signifying one thousand; answering to
the measuring of the time of Oliblish, which is equal with Kolob in its revolution and in
its measuring of time.
Fig. 5. Is called in Egyptian Enish-go-on-dosh; this is one of the governing planets also,
and is said by the Egyptians to be the Sun, and to borrow its light from Kolob through the
medium of Kae-e-vanrash, which is the grand Key, or, in other words, the governing power,
which governs fifteen other fixed planets or stars, as also Floeese or the Moon, the Earth
and the Sun in their annual revolutions. This planet receives its power through the medium
of Kli-flos-is-es, or Hah-ko-kau-beam, the stars represented by numbers 22 and 23, receiving
light from the revolutions of Kolob.
Fig. 6. Represents this earth in its four quarters.
Fig. 7. Represents God sitting upon his throne, revealing through the heavens the grand
Key-words of the Priesthood; as, also, the sign of the Holy Ghost unto Abraham, in the form
of a dove.
Fig. 8. Contains writings that cannot be revealed unto the world; but is to be had in the
Holy Temple of God.
Fig. 9. Ought not to be revealed at the present time.

The above translation is given as far as we have any right to give at the present time.
Abraham 3:23–4:7 38
there were many of the b noble and
great ones;
23 And God saw these souls that
they were good, and he stood in the
midst of them, and he said: These
I will make my rulers; for he stood
among those that were spirits, and
he saw that they were good; and he
said unto me: Abraham, thou art one
of them; thou wast a chosen before
thou wast born.
24 And there stood a one among
them that was like unto God, and he
said unto those who were with him:
We will go down, for there is space
there, and we will take of these materials, and b we will make an earth
whereon these may c dwell;
25 And we will a prove them herewith, to see if they will b do all things
whatsoever the Lord their God shall
command them;
26 And they who a keep their
first b estate shall be added upon;
and they who keep not their first
estate shall not have glory in the
same kingdom with those who keep
their first estate; and they who
keep their second c estate shall have d glory added upon their heads for
ever and ever.
27 And the a Lord said: Whom shall
I b send? And one answered like unto
the Son of Man: Here am I, send me.
And c another answered and said:
Here am I, send me. And the Lord
said: I will d send the first.
28 And the a second was angry, and
kept not his first b estate; and, at that
day, many followed after him.
Chapter 4
The Gods plan the creation of the earth
and all life thereon—Their plans for
the six days of creation are set forth.
And then the Lord said: Let us go
down. And they went down at the
beginning, and they, that is the a Gods, b organized and formed the c heavens
and the earth.
2 And the earth, after it was formed,
was empty and desolate, because they
had not formed anything but the
earth; and a darkness reigned upon
the face of the deep, and the Spirit
of the Gods b was brooding upon the
face of the waters.
3 And they (the Gods) said: Let there
be light; and there was light.
4 And they (the Gods) comprehended the light, for it was a bright;
and they divided the light, or
caused it to be divided, from the
darkness.5 And the Gods called the light Day,
and the darkness they called Night.
And it came to pass that from the
evening until morning they called
a night; and from the morning until the evening they called day;
and this was the first, or the beginning, of that which they called day
and night.6 And the Gods also said: Let there
be an a expanse in the midst of the
waters, and it shall divide the waters
from the waters.
7 And the Gods ordered the expanse, so that it divided the waters
which were under the expanse from

the waters which were above the
expanse; and it was so, even as they
ordered.
8 And the Gods called the expanse,
Heaven. And it came to pass that it
was from evening until morning
that they called night; and it came
to pass that it was from morning until evening that they called day; and
this was the second a time that they
called night and day.
9 And the Gods ordered, saying:
Let the a waters under the heaven be
gathered together unto b one place,
and let the earth come up dry; and
it was so as they ordered;
10 And the Gods pronounced the
dry land, Earth; and the gathering
together of the waters, pronounced
they, a Great Waters; and the Gods
saw that they were obeyed.
11 And the Gods said: Let us prepare the earth to bring forth a grass;
the herb yielding seed; the fruit tree
yielding fruit, after his kind, whose
seed in itself yieldeth its own like- ness upon the earth; and it was so,
even as they ordered.12 And the Gods organized the a earth to bring forth grass from its
own seed, and the herb to bring
forth herb from its own seed, yielding seed after his kind; and the earth
to bring forth the tree from its own
seed, yielding fruit, whose seed could
only bring forth the same in itself,
after his kind; and the Gods saw that
they were obeyed.
13 And it came to pass that they
numbered the days; from the evening until the morning they called
night; and it came to pass, from the
morning until the evening they called
day; and it was the third time.14 And the Gods organized the a lights in the expanse of the heaven,
and caused them to divide the day
from the night; and organized them
to be for signs and for seasons, and
for days and for years;
15 And organized them to be for
lights in the expanse of the heaven
to give light upon the earth; and it
was so.
16 And the Gods organized the
two great lights, the a greater light to
rule the day, and the lesser light
to rule the night; with the lesser
light they set the stars also;
17 And the Gods set them in the
expanse of the heavens, to give light
upon the earth, and to rule over
the day and over the night, and to
cause to divide the light from the
a darkness.18 And the Gods watched those
things which they had a ordered until they obeyed.
19 And it came to pass that it was
from evening until morning that it
was night; and it came to pass that it
was from morning until evening that
it was day; and it was the fourth time.
20 And the Gods said: Let us pre- pare the waters to bring forth abundantly the moving creatures that
have life; and the fowl, that they
may fly above the earth in the open
expanse of heaven.
21 And the Gods prepared the waters that they might bring forth great
a whales, and every living creature
that moveth, which the waters were
to bring forth abundantly after their
kind; and every winged fowl after
their kind. And the Gods saw that
they would be obeyed, and that their
plan was good.
22 And the Gods said: We will bless
them, and cause them to be fruitful
and multiply, and fill the waters in
the seas or a great waters; and cause
the fowl to multiply in the earth.

they called night; and it came to

pass that it was from morning until

was the fifth time.
24 And the Gods prepared the earth
to bring forth the living creature
after his kind, cattle and creeping
things, and beasts of the earth after their kind; and it was so, as they
had said.
25 And the Gods organized the earth
to bring forth the beasts after their
kind, and cattle after their kind, and
every thing that creepeth upon the
earth after its kind; and the Gods
saw they would obey.
26 And the Gods took a counsel
among themselves and said: Let us
go down and b form man in our c image, after our likeness; and we will
give them dominion over the fish of
the sea, and over the fowl of the air,
and over the cattle, and over all the
earth, and over every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth.
27 So the a Gods went down to organize man in their own b image, in the
image of the Gods to form they him,
male and female to form they them.28 And the Gods said: We will
bless them. And the Gods said: We
will cause them to be fruitful and
multiply, and replenish the earth,
and subdue it, and to have dominion over the fish of the sea, and
over the fowl of the air, and over
every living thing that moveth upon
the earth.
29 And the Gods said: Behold, we
will give them every herb bearing seed that shall come upon the
face of all the earth, and every tree
which shall have fruit upon it; yea,
the fruit of the tree yielding seed to
them we will give it; it shall be for
their a meat.
30 And to every beast of the earth,
and to every fowl of the air, and to
every thing that creepeth upon the
earth, behold, we will give them life,
and also we will give to them every
green herb for meat, and all these
things shall be thus organized.
31 And the Gods said: We will do
everything that we have said, and
organize them; and behold, they
shall be very obedient. And it came
to pass that it was from evening
until morning they called night;
and it came to pass that it was from
morning until evening that they
called day; and they numbered the
a sixth time.
Chapter 5
The Gods finish Their planning of the
creation of all things—They bring to pass
the Creation according to Their plans—
Adam names every living creature.
And thus we will finish the heavens
and the earth, and all the a hosts of
them.
2 And the Gods said among themselves: On the seventh time we will
end our work, which we have coun- seled; and we will a rest on the b sev- enth time from all our work which
we have counseled.3 And the Gods concluded upon
the seventh time, because that on the
seventh time they would a rest from
all their b works which they (the
Gods) counseled among themselves
to form; and c sanctified it. And thus
were their decisions at the time
that they counseled among themselves to form the heavens and
the earth.
4 And the Gods came down and
formed these the generations of
the heavens and of the earth, when
they were formed in the day that
the a Gods formed the earth and the
heavens,

had said concerning every plant of

the field before it was in the a earth,
and every herb of the field before it
grew; for the Gods had not caused
it to rain upon the earth when they
counseled to do them, and had not
formed a man to till the ground.
6 But there went up a mist from the
earth, and watered the whole face of
the ground.
7 And the a Gods formed man from
the b dust of the ground, and took his c spirit (that is, the man’s spirit), and
put it into him; and breathed into his
nostrils the breath of life, and man
became a living d soul.
8 And the Gods planted a garden,
eastward in a Eden, and there they
put the man, whose spirit they
had put into the body which they had
formed.
9 And out of the ground made the
Gods to grow every tree that is pleas- ant to the sight and good for food;
the a tree of life, also, in the midst of
the garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
10 There was a river running out
of Eden, to water the garden, and
from thence it was parted and became into four heads.11 And the Gods took the man and
put him in the Garden of Eden, to
dress it and to keep it.12 And the Gods commanded the
man, saying: Of every tree of the gar- den thou mayest freely eat,
13 But of the tree of knowledge of
good and evil, thou shalt not eat of
it; for in the time that thou eatest
thereof, thou shalt surely die. Now
I, Abraham, saw that it was after the
Lord’s a time, which was after the
time of b Kolob; for as yet the Gods
had not appointed unto Adam his
reckoning.
14 And the Gods said: Let us make
an help meet for the man, for it is not
good that the man should be alone,
therefore we will form an help meet
for him.
15 And the Gods caused a deep sleep
to fall upon Adam; and he slept, and
they took one of his ribs, and closed
up the flesh in the stead thereof;
16 And of the rib which the Gods
had taken from man, formed they
a a woman, and brought her unto
the man.
17 And Adam said: This was bone
of my bones, and a flesh of my flesh;
now she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man;
18 Therefore shall a man leave his
father and his mother, and shall
a cleave unto his wife, and they shall
be b one flesh.
19 And they were both naked, the
man and his wife, and were not
a ashamed.20 And out of the ground the Gods
formed every beast of the field, and
every fowl of the air, and brought
them unto Adam to see what he
would call them; and whatsoever
a Adam called every living creature,
that should be the name thereof.
21 And Adam gave a names to all b cattle, to the fowl of the air, to
every beast of the field; and for
Adam, there was found an c help meet
for him.

Jesus foretells the impending destruction
of Jerusalem—He also discourses on the
Second Coming of the Son of Man, and
the destruction of the wicked.
a For I say unto you, that ye shall
not see me henceforth and know
that I am he of whom it is written by the prophets, until ye shall
say: Blessed is he who b cometh in
the name of the Lord, in the clouds
of heaven, and all the holy angels
with him. Then understood his disciples that he should come again on
the earth, after that he was glorified
and c crowned on the right hand
of God.
2 And Jesus went out, and departed
from the temple; and his disciples
came to him, for to a hear him, saying: Master, show us concerning the
buildings of the temple, as thou hast
said—They shall be thrown down,
and left unto you desolate.
3 And Jesus said unto them: See ye
not all these things, and do ye not
understand them? Verily I say unto
you, there shall not be left here, upon
this temple, one a stone upon another
that shall not be thrown down.
4 And Jesus left them, and went
upon the Mount of Olives. And as
he sat upon the Mount of Olives, the
disciples came unto him privately,
saying: Tell us when shall these
things be which thou hast said
concerning the destruction of the
temple, and the Jews; and what is
the a sign of thy b coming, and of the c end of the world, or the destruction
of the d wicked, which is the end of
the world?
5 And Jesus answered, and said
unto them: Take heed that no man
deceive you;
6 For many shall come in my name,
saying—I am a Christ—and shall de- ceive many;
7 Then shall they deliver you up to
be a afflicted, and shall kill you, and
ye shall be b hated of all nations, for
my name’s sake;
8 And then shall many be a offended, and shall betray one another,
and shall hate one another;
9 And many a false prophets shall
arise, and shall deceive many;
10 And because iniquity shall
abound, the a love of many shall wax
cold;
11 But he that remaineth a steadfast
and is not overcome, the same shall
be saved.12 When you, therefore, shall see
the a abomination of b desolation,
spoken of by Daniel the prophet,
concerning the destruction of c Jerusalem, then you shall stand in the

d holy place; whoso readeth let him
understand.
13 Then let them who are in Judea
flee into the a mountains;
14 Let him who is on the housetop
flee, and not return to take anything
out of his house;
15 Neither let him who is in the
field return back to take his clothes;
16 And wo unto them that are with a child, and unto them that give suck
in those days;
17 Therefore, pray ye the Lord that
your flight be not in the winter, nei- ther on the Sabbath day;
18 For then, in those days, shall be
great a tribulation on the b Jews, and
upon the inhabitants of c Jerusalem,
such as was not before sent upon
Israel, of God, since the beginning of
their kingdom until this time; no, nor
ever shall be sent again upon Israel.19 All things which have befallen
them are only the beginning of the
sorrows which shall come upon them.
20 And except those days should be
shortened, there should none of their
flesh be a saved; but for the elect’s
sake, according to the b covenant,
those days shall be shortened.21 Behold, these things I have spoken unto you concerning the Jews;
and again, after the tribulation of
those days which shall come upon
Jerusalem, if any man shall say unto
you, Lo, here is Christ, or there, believe him not;
22 For in those days there shall also
arise false a Christs, and false proph- ets, and shall show great signs and
wonders, insomuch, that, if possible,
they shall deceive the very elect,
who are the elect according to the
covenant.23 Behold, I speak these things unto
you for the a elect’s sake; and you
also shall hear of b wars, and rumors
of wars; see that ye be not troubled,
for all I have told you must come to
pass; but the end is not yet.24 Behold, I have told you before;
25 Wherefore, if they shall say unto
you: Behold, he is in the desert; go
not forth: Behold, he is in the secret
chambers; believe it not;
26 For as the light of the morning
cometh out of the a east, and shineth
even unto the west, and covereth the
whole earth, so shall also the coming
of the Son of Man be.
27 And now I show unto you a parable. Behold, wheresoever the a carcass
is, there will the eagles be b gathered
together; so likewise shall mine elect
be gathered from the four quarters
of the earth.
28 And they shall hear of wars, and
rumors of wars.
29 Behold I speak for mine elect’s
sake; for nation shall rise against
nation, and kingdom against king- dom; there shall be a famines, and
pestilences, and earthquakes, in di- vers places.
30 And again, because iniquity
shall abound, the love of men shall
wax a cold; but he that shall not be
overcome, the same shall be saved.31 And again, this a Gospel of the
Kingdom shall be preached in all the
world, for a witness unto all b nations,
and then shall the end come, or the
destruction of the wicked;
32 And again shall the a abomination
of desolation, spoken of by Daniel
the prophet, be fulfilled.33 And immediately after the
tribulation of those days, the a sun
shall be b darkened, and the moon
shall not give her light, and the

c stars shall fall from heaven, and the
powers of heaven shall be shaken.
34 Verily, I say unto you, this a generation, in which these things shall
be shown forth, shall not pass away
until all I have told you shall be
fulfilled.35 Although, the days will come,
that heaven and earth shall pass
away; yet my a words shall not pass
away, but all shall be fulfilled.
36 And, as I said before, after the a tribulation of those days, and the
powers of the heavens shall be shaken,
then shall appear the sign of the Son
of Man in heaven, and then shall all
the tribes of the earth b mourn; and
they shall see the c Son of Man d coming in the clouds of heaven, with
power and great glory;
37 And whoso a treasureth up my
word, shall not be deceived, for the
Son of Man shall b come, and he shall
send his c angels before him with
the great sound of a trumpet, and
they shall gather together the d remainder of his elect from the four
winds, from one end of heaven to
the other.
38 Now learn a parable of the a fig
tree—When its branches are yet
tender, and it begins to put forth
leaves, you know that summer is
nigh at hand;
39 So likewise, mine elect, when
they shall see all these things, they
shall know that he is near, even at
the doors;
40 But of that day, and hour, no
one a knoweth; no, not the angels of
God in heaven, but my Father only.
41 But as it was in the days of   
a Noah,
so it shall be also at the coming of
the Son of Man;
42 For it shall be with them, as it
was in the days which were before
the a flood; for until the day that Noah
entered into the ark they were eating
and drinking, marrying and giving
in marriage;
43 And a knew not until the flood
came, and took them all away; so
shall also the coming of the Son of
Man be.
44 Then shall be fulfilled that which
is written, that in the a last days, two
shall be in the field, the one shall be
taken, and the other b left;
45 Two shall be grinding at the
mill, the one shall be taken, and the
other left;
46 And what I say unto one, I say
unto all men; a watch, therefore, for
you know not at what hour your Lord
doth come.
47 But know this, if the good man
of the house had known in what
watch the thief would come, he
would have watched, and would
not have suffered his house to have
been broken up, but would have
been ready.
48 Therefore be ye also a ready, for
in such an hour as ye think not, the
Son of Man cometh.
49 Who, then, is a a faithful and wise
servant, whom his lord hath made
ruler over his household, to give them
meat in due season?
50 Blessed is that a servant whom
his lord, when he cometh, shall find
so doing; and verily I say unto you,
he shall make him ruler over all his
goods.
51 But if that evil servant shall say
in his heart: My lord a delayeth his
coming,
52 And shall begin to smite his
fellow-servants, and to eat and drink
with the drunken,
53 The lord of that servant shall
come in a day when he looketh not

Joseph Smith tells of his ancestry, family
members, and their early abodes—An un­ usual excitement about religion prevails
in western New York—He determines to
seek wisdom as directed by James—The
Father and the Son appear, and Joseph is

Owing to the many reports
   which have been put in cir-
 culation by evil-disposed and
designing persons, in relation to the
rise and progress of a The Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, all
of which have been designed by the
authors thereof to militate against its
character as a Church and its progress
in the world—I have been induced
to write this history, to disabuse the
public mind, and put all inquirers
after truth in possession of the b facts,
as they have transpired, in relation
both to myself and the Church,
so far as I have such facts in my
possession.2 In this history I shall present the
various events in relation to this
Church, in truth and righteousness,
as they have transpired, or as they at
present exist, being now [1838] the
a eighth b year since the organization
of the said Church.
3 a I was born in the year of our
Lord one thousand eight hundred
and five, on the twenty-third day
of December, in the town of Sharon,
Windsor county, State of Vermont.
. . .My father, b Joseph Smith, Sen.,
left the State of Vermont, and moved
to Palmyra, Ontario (now Wayne)
county, in the State of New York,
when I was in my tenth year, or there- abouts. In about four years after my
father’s arrival in Palmyra, he moved
with his family into Manchester in
the same county of Ontario—
4 His family consisting of eleven
souls, namely, my father, Joseph
Smith; my a mother, Lucy Smith
(whose name, previous to her marriage, was Mack, daughter of Solomon
Mack); my brothers, b Alvin (who died
November 19th, 1823, in the 26th year
of his age), c Hyrum, myself, d Samuel
Harrison, William, Don Carlos; and
my sisters, Sophronia, Catherine,
and Lucy.5 Some time in the second year after our removal to Manchester, there
was in the place where we lived an
unusual excitement on the subject
of religion. It commenced with the
Methodists, but soon became gen- eral among all the sects in that re- gion of country. Indeed, the whole
district of country seemed affected
by it, and great multitudes united
themselves to the different religious
parties, which created no small stir
and division amongst the people,
some crying, a “Lo, here!” and oth- ers, “Lo, there!” Some were contending for the Methodist faith, some
for the Presbyterian, and some for
the Baptist.

6 For, notwithstanding the great a love which the converts to these different faiths expressed at the time of
their conversion, and the great zeal
manifested by the respective clergy,
who were active in getting up and
promoting this extraordinary scene
of religious feeling, in order to have
everybody converted, as they were
pleased to call it, let them join what
sect they pleased; yet when the converts began to file off, some to one
party and some to another, it was
seen that the seemingly good feelings
of both the priests and the converts
were more b pretended than real; for
a scene of great confusion and bad
feeling ensued—priest contending
against priest, and convert against
convert; so that all their good feelings one for another, if they ever
had any, were entirely lost in a
strife of words and a contest about
opinions.7 I was at this time in my fifteenth
year.My father’s family was proselyted to the Presbyterian faith, and
four of them joined that church,
namely, my mother, Lucy; my broth- ers Hyrum and Samuel Harrison; and
my sister Sophronia.
8 During this time of great excite- ment my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness;
but though my feelings were deep
and often poignant, still I kept myself
aloof from all these parties, though
I attended their several meetings as
often as occasion would permit. In
process of time my mind became
somewhat partial to the Methodist
sect, and I felt some desire to be
united with them; but so great were
the confusion and a strife among the
different denominations, that it was
impossible for a person young as I
was, and so unacquainted with men
and things, to come to any certain
conclusion who was b right and who
was wrong.
9 My mind at times was greatly
excited, the cry and tumult were so
great and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the
Baptists and Methodists, and used
all the powers of both reason and
sophistry to prove their errors, or,
at least, to make the people think
they were in error. On the other
hand, the Baptists and Methodists
in their turn were equally zealous
in endeavoring to establish their
own tenets and disprove all others.
10 In the midst of this war of words
and tumult of opinions, I often said
to myself: What is to be done? Who
of all these parties are right; or, are
they all wrong together? If any one
of them be a right, which is it, and
how shall I know it?
11 While I was laboring under
the extreme difficulties caused by
the contests of these parties of reli- gionists, I was one day reading the
a Epistle of James, first chapter and
fifth verse, which reads: If any of you
lack b wisdom, let him ask of God, that
giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth
not; and it shall be given him.
12 Never did any passage of a scripture come with more power to the
heart of man than this did at this
time to mine. It seemed to enter with
great force into every feeling of my
heart. I reflected on it again and
again, knowing that if any person
needed b wisdom from God, I did; for
how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I
then had, I would never know; for the
teachers of religion of the different
sects c understood the same passages
of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the
question by an appeal to the Bible.13 At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain
in a darkness and confusion, or else
I must do as James directs, that is,
ask of God. I at length came to the
determination to “ask of God,” concluding that if he gave wisdom to

them that lacked wisdom, and would
b give liberally, and not upbraid, I
might venture.
14 So, in accordance with this, my
determination to ask of God, I retired
to the a woods to make the attempt.
It was on the morning of a b beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of
eighteen hundred and twenty. It was
the first time in my life that I had
made such an attempt, for amidst
all my anxieties I had never as yet
made the attempt to c pray d vocally.15 After I had retired to the place
where I had previously designed to
go, having looked around me, and
finding myself alone, I kneeled down
and began to offer up the desires of
my heart to God. I had scarcely done
so, when immediately I was a seized
upon by some power which entirely
overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind
my tongue so that I could not speak.Thick b darkness gathered around me,
and it seemed to me for a time as if I
were doomed to sudden destruction.
16 But, exerting all my powers to a call upon God to deliver me out of
the power of this enemy which had
seized upon me, and at the very
moment when I was ready to sink
into b despair and abandon myself
to destruction—not to an imaginary
ruin, but to the power of some actual
being from the unseen world, who
had such marvelous power as I had
never before felt in any being—just
at this moment of great alarm, I saw
a pillar of c light exactly over my
head, above the brightness of the
d sun, which descended gradually
until it fell upon me.17 It no sooner appeared than I
found myself a delivered from the
enemy which held me bound. When
the light rested upon me I b saw two c Personages, whose brightness and
d glory defy all description, e standing above me in the air. One of them
spake unto me, calling me by name
and said, pointing to the other—This
is My f Beloved g Son. Hear Him!
18 My object in going to a inquire of
the Lord was to know which of all
the sects was right, that I might know
which to join. No sooner, therefore,
did I get possession of myself, so as
to be able to speak, than I asked the
Personages who stood above me in
the light, which of all the sects was
right (for at this time it had never
entered into my heart that all were
wrong)—and which I should join.
19 I was answered that I must join
none of them, for they were all
a wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds
were an abomination in his sight; that
those b professors were all c corrupt;
that: “they d draw near to me with
their lips, but their e hearts are far
from me, they teach for doctrines
the f commandments of men, having
a form of godliness, but they deny
the g power thereof.”

20 He again forbade me to join with
any of them; and many other things
did he say unto me, which I cannot
write at this time.When I came to
myself again, I found myself a lying
on my back, looking up into heaven.
When the light had departed, I had
no strength; but soon recovering in
some degree, I went home. And as I
leaned up to the fireplace, b mother
inquired what the matter was. I replied, “Never mind, all is well—I am
well enough off.” I then said to my
mother, “I have learned for myself
that Presbyterianism is not true.” It
seems as though the c adversary was
aware, at a very early period of my
life, that I was destined to prove a
disturber and an annoyer of his
kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me?
Why the d opposition and persecution
that arose against me, almost in my
infancy ?
Some preachers and other professors of
religion reject the account of the First
Vision—Persecution is heaped upon
Joseph Smith—He testifies of the reality of the vision. (Verses 21–26.)
21 Some few days after I had this
vision, I happened to be in company
with one of the Methodist preachers,
who was very active in the before
mentioned religious excitement; and,
conversing with him on the subject
of religion, I took occasion to give
him an account of the vision which
I had had. I was greatly surprised at
his behavior; he treated my communication not only lightly, but with
great contempt, saying it was all of
the devil, that there were no such
things as a visions or b revelations in
these days; that all such things had
ceased with the apostles, and that
there would never be any more of
them.22 I soon found, however, that my
telling the story had excited a great
deal of prejudice against me among
professors of religion, and was the
cause of great a persecution, which
continued to increase; and though I
was an b obscure boy, only between
fourteen and fifteen years of age,
and my circumstances in life such as
to make a boy of no consequence in
the world, yet men of high standing
would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, and
create a bitter persecution; and this
was common among all the sects—
all united to persecute me.
23 It caused me serious reflection
then, and often has since, how very
strange it was that an obscure a boy,
of a little over fourteen years of age,
and one, too, who was doomed to the
necessity of obtaining a scanty main- tenance by his daily b labor, should
be thought a character of sufficient
importance to attract the attention
of the great ones of the most popular
sects of the day, and in a manner to
create in them a spirit of the most
bitter c persecution and d reviling.But strange or not, so it was, and it
was often the cause of great sorrow
to myself.24 However, it was nevertheless a
fact that I had beheld a a vision. I
have thought since, that I felt much
like Paul, when he made his defense
before King Agrippa, and related
the account of the vision he had
when he saw a light, and heard a
voice; but still there were but few
who believed him; some said he was
dishonest, others said he was b mad;
and he was ridiculed and reviled.
But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a

vision, he knew he had, and all the
c persecution under heaven could not
make it otherwise; and though they
should persecute him unto death,
yet he knew, and would know to his
latest breath, that he had both seen
a light and heard a voice speaking
unto him, and all the world could
not make him think or believe
otherwise.
25 So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of
that light I saw two a Personages, and
they did in reality speak to me; and
though I was b hated and c persecuted
for saying that I had seen a vision,
yet it was true; and while they were
persecuting me, reviling me, and
speaking all manner of evil against
me d falsely for so saying, I was led to
say in my heart: Why persecute me
for telling the truth? I have actually
seen a vision; and who am I that I
can withstand God, or why does the
world think to make me deny what
I have actually seen? For I had seen
a vision; I knew it, and I knew that
God knew it, and I could not e deny it,
neither dared I do it; at least I knew
that by so doing I would offend God,
and come under condemnation.
26 I had now got my mind satisfied
so far as the sectarian world was concerned—that it was not my duty to
join with any of them, but to continue as I was until further a directed.
I had found the testimony of James
to be true—that a man who lacked
wisdom might ask of God, and ob- tain, and not be b upbraided.
Moroni appears to Joseph Smith—
Joseph’s name is to be known for good
and evil among all nations—Moroni
tells him of the Book of Mormon and of
the coming judgments of the Lord and
quotes many scriptures—The hiding
place of the gold plates is revealed—
Moroni continues to instruct the
Prophet. (Verses 27–54.)
27 I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the
twenty-first of September, one thousand eight hundred and twentythree, all the time suffering severe
persecution at the hands of all
classes of men, both religious and
irreligious, because I continued to
a affirm that I had seen a vision.
28 During the space of time which
intervened between the time I had
the vision and the year eighteen
hundred and twenty-three—having
been forbidden to join any of the
religious sects of the day, and being
of very tender years, and persecuted
by those who ought to have been
my a friends and to have treated me
kindly, and if they supposed me to
be deluded to have endeavored in
a proper and affectionate manner
to have reclaimed me—I was left
to all kinds of b temptations; and,
mingling with all kinds of society,
I frequently fell into many foolish
c errors, and displayed the weakness
of youth, and the foibles of human
nature; which, I am sorry to say, led
me into divers temptations, offen- sive in the sight of God. In making
this confession, no one need suppose
me guilty of any great or malignant
sins. A disposition to commit such
was never in my nature. But I was
guilty of d levity, and sometimes associated with jovial company, etc., not
consistent with that character which
ought to be maintained by one who
was e called of God as I had been. But
this will not seem very strange to any
one who recollects my youth, and is
acquainted with my native f cheery
temperament.29 In consequence of these things,
I often felt condemned for my

weakness and imperfections; when,
on the evening of the abovementioned twenty-first of September,
after I had retired to my bed for the
night, I betook myself to a prayer and
supplication to Almighty God for
forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to
me, that I might know of my state
and standing before him; for I had
full b confidence in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously
had one.
30 While I was thus in the act of
calling upon God, I discovered a
a light appearing in my room, which
continued to increase until the room
was lighter than at noonday, when
immediately a b personage appeared
at my bedside, standing in the air,
for his feet did not touch the floor.
31 He had on a loose robe of most
exquisite a whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had
ever seen; nor do I believe that any
earthly thing could be made to ap- pear so exceedingly white and bril- liant. His hands were naked, and his
arms also, a little above the wrist; so,
also, were his feet naked, as were
his legs, a little above the ankles.His head and neck were also bare. I
could discover that he had no other
clothing on but this robe, as it was
open, so that I could see into his
bosom.
32 Not only was his robe exceed- ingly white, but his whole person
was a glorious beyond description,
and his countenance truly like
b lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright
as immediately around his person.
When I first looked upon him, I was c afraid; but the d fear soon left me.
33 He called me by a name, and said
unto me that he was a b messenger sent
from the presence of God to me, and
that his name was Moroni; that God
had a work for me to do; and that
my name should be had for c good
and evil among all nations, kindreds,
and tongues, or that it should be
both good and evil spoken of among
all people.
34 He said there was a a book de- posited, written upon gold plates,
giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the
source from whence they sprang. He
also said that the b fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as
delivered by the Savior to the ancient
inhabitants;
35 Also, that there were two stones
in silver bows—and these stones,
fastened to a a breastplate, constituted what is called the b Urim and
Thummim—deposited with the
plates; and the possession and use of
these stones were what constituted
c “seers” in ancient or former times;
and that God had prepared them for
the purpose of translating the book.
36 After telling me these things, he
commenced quoting the prophecies
of the Old Testament.He first quoted
part of the a third chapter of Malachi;
and he quoted also the fourth or last
chapter of the same prophecy, though
with a little variation from the way it
reads in our Bibles. Instead of quot- ing the first verse as it reads in our
books, he quoted it thus:
37 For behold, the a day cometh that
shall b burn as an oven, and all the

proud, yea, and all that do wickedly
shall burn as c stubble; for they that
come shall burn them, saith the Lord of
Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root
nor branch.
38 And again, he quoted the fifth
verse thus: Behold, I will reveal unto
you the a Priesthood, by the hand of b Elijah the prophet, before the coming of
the great and dreadful day of the c Lord.
39 He also quoted the next verse
differently: And he shall plant in the
hearts of the a children the b promises
made to the fathers, and the hearts of
the children shall turn to their fathers.
If it were not so, the whole earth would
be utterly wasted at his coming.
40 In addition to these, he quoted
the a eleventh chapter of Isaiah, saying that it was about to be fulfilled.
He quoted also the third chapter of
Acts, twenty-second and twentythird verses, precisely as they stand
in our New Testament. He said that
that b prophet was Christ; but the day
had not yet come when “they who
would not hear his voice should be
c cut off from among the people,” but
soon would come.
41 He also quoted the a second chap- ter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth
verse to the last. He also said that this
was not yet fulfilled, but was soon
to be. And he further stated that the
fulness of the b Gentiles was soon to
come in. He quoted many other passages of scripture, and offered many
explanations which c cannot be mentioned here.42 Again, he told me, that when I
got those plates of which he had spo- ken—for the time that they should
be obtained was not yet fulfilled—
I should not show them to any per- son; neither the breastplate with the
Urim and Thummim; only to those
to whom I should be commanded
to show them; if I did I should be
a destroyed. While he was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened to my b mind that I
could see the place where the plates
were deposited, and that so clearly
and distinctly that I knew the place
again when I visited it.
43 After this communication, I saw
the light in the room begin to gather
immediately around the person of
him who had been speaking to me,
and it continued to do so until the
room was again left dark, except
just around him; when, instantly I
saw, as it were, a conduit open right
up into heaven, and he a ascended
till he entirely disappeared, and the
room was left as it had been before
this heavenly light had made its
appearance.
44 I lay musing on the singularity
of the scene, and marveling greatly
at what had been told to me by this
extraordinary messenger; when, in
the midst of my a meditation, I sud- denly discovered that my room was
again beginning to get lighted, and
in an instant, as it were, the same
heavenly messenger was again by
my bedside.
45 He commenced, and a again related the very same things which
he had done at his first visit, without the least variation; which hav- ing done, he informed me of great
b judgments which were coming upon
the earth, with great desolations by
c famine, d sword, and pestilence; and

that these grievous judgments would
come on the earth in this generation.
Having related these things, he again
ascended as he had done before.
46 By this time, so deep were the
impressions made on my mind, that
sleep had fled from my eyes, and I
lay overwhelmed in a astonishment at
what I had both seen and heard.But
what was my surprise when again I
beheld the same messenger at my
bedside, and heard him rehearse or
repeat over again to me the same
things as before; and added a caution
to me, telling me that Satan would
try to b tempt me (in consequence of
the indigent circumstances of my
father’s family), to get the plates for
the purpose of getting c rich. This
he forbade me, saying that I must
have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God,
and must not be influenced by any
other d motive than that of building
his kingdom; otherwise I could not
get them.
47 After this third visit, he again
ascended into heaven as before,
and I was again left to a ponder on
the strangeness of what I had just
experienced; when almost immediately after the heavenly messenger
had ascended from me for the third
time, the cock crowed, and I found
that day was approaching, so that
our interviews must have occupied
the whole of that night.
48 I shortly after arose from my bed,
and, as usual, went to the necessary
labors of the day; but, in attempting
to work as at other times, I found my
a strength so exhausted as to render
me entirely unable.My father, who
was laboring along with me, discov- ered something to be wrong with me,
and told me to go home.I started
with the intention of going to the
house; but, in attempting to cross the
fence out of the field where we were,
my strength entirely failed me, and
I b fell helpless on the ground, and
for a time was quite unconscious of
anything.49 The first thing that I can recol- lect was a voice speaking unto me,
calling me by name. I looked up, and
beheld the same messenger standing
over my head, surrounded by light
as before.He then again related unto
me all that he had related to me the
previous night, and commanded me
to go to my a father and tell him of
the vision and commandments which
I had received.
50 I obeyed; I returned to my a father
in the field, and rehearsed the whole
matter to him.He b replied to me that
it was of God, and told me to go and
do as commanded by the messenger.
I left the field, and went to the place
where the messenger had told me the
plates were deposited; and owing to
the distinctness of the vision which
I had had concerning it, I knew the
place the instant that I arrived there.51 Convenient to the village of
Manchester, Ontario county, New
York, stands a a hill of considerable
size, and the most elevated of any in
the neighborhood. On the west side
of this hill, not far from the top, under a stone of considerable size, lay
the plates, deposited in a stone box.
This stone was thick and rounding
in the middle on the upper side, and
thinner towards the edges, so that the
middle part of it was visible above
the ground, but the edge all around
was covered with earth.
52 Having removed the earth, I
obtained a lever, which I got fixed
under the edge of the stone, and
with a little exertion raised it up.
I looked in, and there indeed did I
behold the a plates, the b Urim and
Thummim, and the breastplate, as

stated by the messenger. The box
in which they lay was formed by
laying stones together in some kind
of cement. In the bottom of the box
were laid two stones crossways of
the box, and on these stones lay
the plates and the other things
with them.
53 I made an attempt to take them
out, but was forbidden by the messenger, and was again informed that
the time for bringing them forth had
not yet arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time; but he
told me that I should come to that
place precisely in one year from that
time, and that he would there meet
with me, and that I should continue
to do so until the time should come
for obtaining the plates.
54 Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each
year, and at each time I found the
same messenger there, and received
instruction and intelligence from
him at each of our interviews, respecting what the Lord was going
to do, and how and in what manner
his a kingdom was to be conducted
in the last days.

(Verses 55–65.)
55 As my father’s worldly circumstances were very limited, we were
under the necessity of a laboring
with our hands, hiring out by day’s
work and otherwise, as we could get
opportunity. Sometimes we were at
home, and sometimes abroad, and
by continuous b labor were enabled
to get a comfortable maintenance.
56 In the year 1823 my father’s
family met with a great a affliction
by the death of my eldest brother,
b Alvin. In the month of October, 1825,
I hired with an old gentleman by the
name of Josiah Stoal, who lived in
Chenango county, State of New York.
He had heard something of a silver
mine having been opened by the
Spaniards in Harmony, Susquehanna
county, State of Pennsylvania; and
had, previous to my hiring to him,
been digging, in order, if possible,
to discover the mine. After I went to
live with him, he took me, with the
rest of his hands, to dig for the silver
mine, at which I continued to work
for nearly a month, without success
in our undertaking, and finally I prevailed with the old gentleman to cease
digging after it. Hence arose the very
prevalent story of my having been a
money-digger.
57 During the time that I was thus
employed, I was put to board with
a Mr. Isaac Hale, of that place; it
was there I first saw my wife (his
daughter), Emma Hale. On the 18th
of January, 1827, we were married,
while I was yet employed in the service of Mr. Stoal.58 Owing to my continuing to as- sert that I had seen a vision, a persecution still followed me, and my
wife’s father’s family were very
much opposed to our being mar- ried. I was, therefore, under the necessity of taking her elsewhere; so
we went and were married at the
house of Squire Tarbill, in South
Bainbridge, Chenango county, New
York. Immediately after my mar- riage, I left Mr. Stoal’s, and went to
my father’s, and b farmed with him
that season.
59 At length the time arrived for
obtaining the plates, the Urim and
Thummim, and the breastplate. On
the twenty-second day of September,
one thousand eight hundred and
twenty-seven, having gone as usual
at the end of another year to the
place where they were deposited,
the same heavenly messenger de- livered them up to a me with this

charge: that I should be b responsible
for them; that if I should let them go
carelessly, or through any c neglect of
mine, I should be cut off; but that if
I would use all my endeavors to d preserve them, until he, the messenger,
should call for them, they should be
protected.
60 I soon found out the reason why
I had received such strict charges to
keep them safe, and why it was that
the messenger had said that when I
had done what was required at my
hand, he would call for them. For
no sooner was it known that I had
them, than the most strenuous exertions were used to a get them from
me. Every stratagem that could be
invented was resorted to for that
purpose. The persecution became
more bitter and severe than be- fore, and multitudes were on the
alert continually to get them from
me if possible. But by the wisdom
of God, they remained safe in my
hands, until I had accomplished by
them what was required at my hand.When, according to arrangements,
the messenger called for them, I
delivered them up to him; and he
has them in his charge until this
b day, being the second day of May,
one thousand eight hundred and
thirty-eight.
61 The excitement, however, still
continued, and rumor with her
thousand tongues was all the time
employed in circulating a falsehoods about my father’s family, and
about myself. If I were to relate a
thousandth part of them, it would
fill up volumes. The persecution,
however, became so intolerable that
I was under the necessity of leaving
Manchester, and going with my wife
to Susquehanna county, in the State
of Pennsylvania. While preparing to
start—being very poor, and the per- secution so heavy upon us that there
was no probability that we would
ever be otherwise—in the midst of
our afflictions we found a friend in
a gentleman by the name of b Martin
Harris, who came to us and gave
me fifty dollars to assist us on our
journey. Mr. Harris was a resident of
Palmyra township, Wayne county, in
the State of New York, and a farmer
of respectability.62 By this timely aid was I enabled
to reach the place of my destination
in Pennsylvania; and immediately
after my arrival there I commenced
copying the characters off the plates.I copied a considerable number of
them, and by means of the a Urim
and Thummim I translated some of
them, which I did between the time
I arrived at the house of my wife’s
father, in the month of December,
and the February following.
63 Sometime in this month of
February, the aforementioned
Mr. Martin Harris came to our place,
got the characters which I had drawn
off the plates, and started with them
to the city of New York. For what
took place relative to him and the
characters, I refer to his own account
of the circumstances, as he related
them to me after his return, which
was as follows:
64 “I went to the city of New York,
and presented the characters which
had been translated, with the translation thereof, to Professor Charles
Anthon, a gentleman celebrated for
his literary attainments. Professor
Anthon stated that the translation
was correct, more so than any he
had before seen translated from the
Egyptian. I then showed him those
which were not yet translated, and
he said that they were Egyptian,
Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic; and
he said they were true characters. He
gave me a certificate, certifying to the
people of Palmyra that they were true
characters, and that the translation of
such of them as had been translated

was also correct. I took the certificate and put it into my pocket, and
was just leaving the house, when
Mr. Anthon called me back, and
asked me how the young man found
out that there were gold plates in
the place where he found them. I
answered that an angel of God had
revealed it unto him.
65 “He then said to me, ‘Let me see
that certificate.’ I accordingly took it
out of my pocket and gave it to him,
when he took it and tore it to pieces,
saying that there was no such thing
now as ministering of a angels, and
that if I would bring the plates to
him he would translate them. I informed him that part of the plates
were b sealed, and that I was forbidden
to bring them. He replied, ‘I cannot
read a sealed book.’ I left him and
went to Dr. Mitchell, who sanctioned
what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the
translation.”

Oliver Cowdery serves as scribe in
translating the Book of Mormon—
Joseph and Oliver receive the Aaronic
Priesthood from John the Baptist—
They are baptized, ordained, and re­ ceive the spirit of prophecy. (Verses
66–75.)
66 On the 5th day of April, 1829, a Oliver Cowdery came to my house,
until which time I had never seen
him. He stated to me that having
been teaching school in the neighborhood where my father resided, and
my father being one of those who
sent to the school, he went to board
for a season at his house, and while
there the family related to him the
circumstances of my having received
the plates, and accordingly he had
come to make inquiries of me.
67 Two days after the arrival of
Mr. Cowdery (being the 7th of April)
I commenced to translate the Book
of Mormon, and he began to a write
for me.
· · · · · · ·
68 We still continued the work of
translation, when, in the ensuing
month (May, 1829), we on a certain
day went into the woods to pray and
inquire of the Lord respecting a bap- tism for the b remission of sins, that
we found mentioned in the translation of the plates. While we were thus
employed, praying and calling upon
the Lord, a messenger from heaven
descended in a c cloud of light, and
having laid his d hands upon us, he e ordained us, saying:
69 Upon you my fellow servants,
in the name of Messiah, I confer the
a Priesthood of b Aaron, which holds the
keys of the ministering of angels, and
of the gospel of repentance, and of c baptism by immersion for the remission
of sins; and this shall never be taken
again from the earth until the sons of
d Levi do offer again an offering unto
the Lord in e righteousness.
70 He said this Aaronic Priesthood
had not the power of laying on hands
for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but
that this should be conferred on us
hereafter; and he commanded us to
go and be baptized, and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver
Cowdery, and that afterwards he
should baptize me.
71 Accordingly we went and were
baptized. I a baptized him first, and
afterwards he baptized me—after

which I laid my hands upon his head
and ordained him to the Aaronic
Priesthood, and afterwards he laid
his hands on me and ordained me
to the same Priesthood—for so we
were commanded.*
72 The a messenger who visited
us on this occasion and conferred
this Priesthood upon us, said that
his name was John, the same that
is called b John the Baptist in the
New Testament, and that he acted
under the direction of c Peter, James
and John, who held the keys of the
Priesthood of Melchizedek, which
Priesthood, he said, would in due
time be conferred on us, and that I
should be called the first d Elder of
the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery)
the second. It was on the fifteenth day
of May, 1829, that we were ordained
under the hand of this messenger,
and baptized.
73 Immediately on our coming up
out of the water after we had been
baptized, we experienced great and
glorious blessings from our Heavenly
Father. No sooner had I baptized
Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost
fell upon him, and he stood up and
a prophesied many things which
should shortly come to pass. And
again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit
of prophecy, when, standing up, I
prophesied concerning the rise of
this Church, and many other things
connected with the Church, and this
generation of the children of men. We
were filled with the Holy Ghost, and
rejoiced in the God of our salvation.
74 Our minds being now enlight- ened, we began to have the a scriptures
laid open to our understandings, and
the b true meaning and intention of
their more c mysterious passages revealed unto us in a manner which
we never could attain to previously,
nor ever before had thought of. In
the meantime we were forced to keep
secret the circumstances of having
received the Priesthood and our having been baptized, owing to a spirit of
persecution which had already manifested itself in the neighborhood.
75 We had been threatened with being mobbed, from time to time, and
this, too, by professors of religion.
And their intentions of mobbing
us were only counteracted by the
influence of my wife’s father’s family (under Divine providence), who
had become very a friendly to me,
and who were opposed to mobs, and
were willing that I should be allowed
to continue the work of translation
without interruption; and therefore
offered and promised us protection
from all unlawful proceedings, as
far as in them lay.

* Oliver Cowdery describes these events thus: “These were days never to be for- gotten—to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven, awak- ened the utmost gratitude of this bosom! Day after day I continued, uninterrupted,
to write from his mouth, as he translated with the Urim and Thummim, or, as the
Nephites would have said, ‘Interpreters,’ the history or record called ‘The Book of
Mormon.’ “To notice, in even few words, the interesting account given by Mormon and his
faithful son, Moroni, of a people once beloved and favored of heaven, would super- sede my present design; I shall therefore defer this to a future period, and, as I said
in the introduction, pass more directly to some few incidents immediately connected
with the rise of this Church, which may be entertaining to some thousands who have
stepped forward, amid the frowns of bigots and the calumny of hypocrites, and em- braced the Gospel of Christ.“No men, in their sober senses, could translate and write the directions given to the
Nephites from the mouth of the Savior, of the precise manner in which men should 
59 Joseph Smith—History
build up His Church, and especially when corruption had spread an uncertainty over
all forms and systems practiced among men, without desiring a privilege of showing
the willingness of the heart by being buried in the liquid grave, to answer a ‘good
conscience by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.’ “After writing the account given of the Savior’s ministry to the remnant of the
seed of Jacob, upon this continent, it was easy to be seen, as the prophet said it would
be, that darkness covered the earth and gross darkness the minds of the people. On
reflecting further it was as easy to be seen that amid the great strife and noise con- cerning religion, none had authority from God to administer the ordinances of the
Gospel. For the question might be asked, have men authority to administer in the
name of Christ, who deny revelations, when His testimony is no less than the spirit of
prophecy, and His religion based, built, and sustained by immediate revelations, in all
ages of the world when He has had a people on earth? If these facts were buried, and
carefully concealed by men whose craft would have been in danger if once permitted
to shine in the faces of men, they were no longer to us; and we only waited for the
commandment to be given ‘Arise and be baptized.’ “This was not long desired before it was realized. The Lord, who is rich in mercy,
and ever willing to answer the consistent prayer of the humble, after we had called
upon Him in a fervent manner, aside from the abodes of men, condescended to mani- fest to us His will. On a sudden, as from the midst of eternity, the voice of the Re- deemer spake peace to us, while the veil was parted and the angel of God came down
clothed with glory, and delivered the anxiously looked for message, and the keys of
the Gospel of repentance. What joy! what wonder! what amazement! While the world
was racked and distracted—while millions were groping as the blind for the wall, and
while all men were resting upon uncertainty, as a general mass, our eyes beheld, our
ears heard, as in the ‘blaze of day’; yes, more—above the glitter of the May sunbeam,
which then shed its brilliancy over the face of nature! Then his voice, though mild,
pierced to the center, and his words, ‘I am thy fellow-servant,’ dispelled every fear. We listened, we gazed, we admired! ’Twas the voice of an angel from glory, ’twas a mes- sage from the Most High! And as we heard we rejoiced, while His love enkindled upon
our souls, and we were wrapped in the vision of the Almighty! Where was room for
doubt? Nowhere; uncertainty had fled, doubt had sunk no more to rise, while fiction
and deception had fled forever!
“But, dear brother, think, further think for a moment, what joy filled our hearts,
and with what surprise we must have bowed, (for who would not have bowed the knee
for such a blessing?) when we received under his hand the Holy Priesthood as he said,
‘Upon you my fellow-servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer this Priesthood and
this authority, which shall remain upon earth, that the Sons of Levi may yet offer an
offering unto the Lord in righteousness!’
“I shall not attempt to paint to you the feelings of this heart, nor the majestic
beauty and glory which surrounded us on this occasion; but you will believe me when
I say, that earth, nor men, with the eloquence of time, cannot begin to clothe language
in as interesting and sublime a manner as this holy personage. No; nor has this earth
power to give the joy, to bestow the peace, or comprehend the wisdom which was con- tained in each sentence as they were delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit! Man
may deceive his fellow-men, deception may follow deception, and the children of the
wicked one may have power to seduce the foolish and untaught, till naught but fiction
feeds the many, and the fruit of falsehood carries in its current the giddy to the grave;
but one touch with the finger of his love, yes, one ray of glory from the upper world,
or one word from the mouth of the Savior, from the bosom of eternity, strikes it all
into insignificance, and blots it forever from the mind. The assurance that we were in
the presence of an angel, the certainty that we heard the voice of Jesus, and the truth
unsullied as it flowed from a pure personage, dictated by the will of God, is to me past
description, and I shall ever look upon this expression of the Savior’s goodness with
wonder and thanksgiving while I am permitted to tarry; and in those mansions where
perfection dwells and sin never comes, I hope to adore in that day which shall never
cease.”—Messenger and Advocate, vol. 1 (October 1834), pp. 14–16.

The Articles of Faith
of The Churc h of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints
We a believe in b God, the
Eternal Father, and in His
c Son, Jesus Christ, and in the d Holy Ghost.2 We believe that men will be a pun- ished for their b own sins, and not for c Adam’s transgression.
3 We believe that through the a Atonement of Christ, all b man- kind may be c saved, by obedience
to the laws and ordinances of the
Gospel.
4 We believe that the first principles
and a ordinances of the Gospel are:
first, b Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ;
second, c Repentance; third, d Baptism
by e immersion for the f remission of
sins; fourth, Laying on of g hands for
the h gift of the Holy Ghost.5 We believe that a man must be a called of God, by b prophecy, and
by the laying on of c hands by those
who are in d authority, to e preach the
Gospel and administer in the f ordinances thereof.
6 We believe in the same a organi- zation that existed in the Primitive
Church, namely, apostles, b prophets, c pastors, d teachers, e evangelists, and
so forth.7 We believe in the a gift of b tongues, c prophecy, d revelation, e visions, f  healing, g interpretation of tongues, and
so forth.
8 We believe the a Bible to be the b word of God as far as it is translated
c correctly; we also believe the d Book
of Mormon to be the word of God.9 We believe all that God has a revealed, all that He does now reveal,
and we believe that He will yet
b reveal many great and important
things pertaining to the Kingdom
of God.
61 Articles of Faith 1:10–13
10 We believe in the literal a gathering of Israel and in the restoration
of the b Ten Tribes; that c Zion (the
New Jerusalem) will be built upon
the American continent; that Christ
will d reign personally upon the earth;
and, that the earth will be e renewed
and receive its f paradisiacal g glory.
11 We claim the a privilege of wor- shiping Almighty God according to
the b dictates of our own c conscience,
and allow all men the same privi- lege, let them d worship how, where,
or what they may.12 We believe in being a subject
to b kings, presidents, rulers, and
magistrates, in c obeying, honoring,
and sustaining the d law.13 a We believe in being b honest,
true, c chaste, d benevolent, virtuous,
and in doing e good to all men; indeed, we may say that we follow the
admonition of Paul—We believe all
things, we f  hope all things, we have
endured many things, and hope to
be able to g endure all things. If there
is anything h virtuous, i lovely, or of
good report or praiseworthy, we seek
after these things.
